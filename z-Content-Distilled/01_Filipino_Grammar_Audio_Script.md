# Audio Script: Filipino Grammar Fundamentals

**Narrator**: Welcome to this audio lesson on Filipino Grammar Fundamentals. Today, we're going to explore how sentences are built in Tagalog.

**Teacher**: Tagalog sentence structure is quite flexible, but it's a bit different from English. In English, we usually follow a Subject-Predicate order. But in Tagalog, the most natural way to speak is to use a Predicate-Subject order.

**Narrator**: That sounds complicated, but it's actually simple. It just means the "action" or "description" usually comes first.

**Teacher**: Exactly. Let's listen to an example.

**Student (Filipino)**: Maganda ang babae.

**Teacher**: That means "The woman is beautiful". But literally, it translates to "Beautiful... the woman".

**Narrator**: Notice how the description "Maganda" came before the subject "ang babae".

**Teacher**: Let's try another one. This time with an action.

**Student (Filipino)**: Kumain si Juan.

**Teacher**: "Juan ate". Again, the action "Kumain" is first.

**Narrator**: [PAUSE]

**Narrator**: Now, let's talk about the "Ay" form. You might see this in books.

**Teacher**: Yes, the "Ay" form looks more like English structure.

**Student (Filipino)**: Ang babae ay maganda.

**Teacher**: "The woman is beautiful". This uses the marker "ay" to link the subject and the description. But remember, native speakers rarely use this in casual conversation. It's better to stick to the first method we learned.
