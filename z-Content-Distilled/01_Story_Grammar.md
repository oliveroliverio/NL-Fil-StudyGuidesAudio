## Ang Palengke (The Market)

**Narrator**: Lia is rushing through the busy morning market, the *palengke*. She has two important tasks: buying ingredients and finding a lost item. The air is thick with the smell of seafood and spices.

[SFX: Busy market sounds, vendors shouting, chickens clucking]

**Narrator**: She approaches Mang Nestor’s stall, a vendor known for having the best produce.

**Lia**: *Magandang umaga, Mang Nestor!*

**Mang Nestor**: *Magandang umaga, Lia! Anong kailangan mo?* (Good morning, Lia! What do you need?)

**Lia**: *Kailangan ko **ng** manok at **ng** gulay.* (I need chicken and vegetables.)

**Narrator**: Lia uses the **Ng** marker because the items are the direct objects of her need. Mang Nestor points to the back of his display.

**Mang Nestor**: *Tingnan mo **ang** mga ito. Sariwa**ng** sariwa **ang** manok namin.* (Look at these. Our chicken is very, very fresh.)

**Lia**: *Wow, mukha**ng** masarap!* (Wow, it looks delicious!)

**Narrator**: Notice how Mang Nestor used the natural Predicate-Subject order (*Sariwang sariwa ang manok*) and Lia used the linker **-ng** to connect the adjective *mukha* (looks) to the implied predicate.

**Narrator**: Lia remembers the second, more difficult errand.

**Lia**: *Mang Nestor, **may** nakita ka bang salamin?* (Mang Nestor, did you see any glasses?)

**Narrator**: She uses **May** to ask about the existence of the glasses.

**Mang Nestor**: *Salamin? **Wala** akong nakita dito **sa** stall ko.* (Glasses? I didn't see any here at my stall.)

**Lia**: *Ay, sayang. **Nasaan** kaya **ang** bag **ni** Tita Susan?* (Oh, what a shame. Where could Tita Susan's bag be?)

**Narrator**: Lia uses **Nasaan** (Where is the object) and the proper noun possessive marker **Ni** to indicate the owner of the bag.

**Mang Nestor**: *Teka... **Mayroon** akong naaalala.* (Wait... I remember something.)

**Lia**: *Ano po?* (What is it?)

**Mang Nestor**: *Kanina, **may** malaki**ng** bag **sa** tabi **ng** mesa. Nakita **ni** Aling Bebang. Ibinigay ko **kay** Aling Bebang.* (Earlier, there was a big bag beside the table. Aling Bebang saw it. I gave it to Aling Bebang.)

**Narrator**: Mang Nestor confirmed existence with **Mayroon** and **May**, linked the adjective to the noun with **-ng** (*malaking bag*), marked the location with **Sa**, and used **Kay** to show the recipient of the bag (Aling Bebang).

**Narrator**: Lia feels relieved. She quickly finishes her purchase.

**Lia**: *Sige po. Kukuha ako **ng** kalahati**ng** kilo **ng** manok.* (Okay, sir. I will get half a kilo of chicken.)

**Mang Nestor**: *Magkano **ang** kailangan mo **ng** sibuyas?* (How much onion do you need?)

**Lia**: *Kaunti lang. **Magkano** po **ang** lahat?* (Just a little. How much is everything?)

**Mang Nestor**: *Apat na raan lahat.* (Four hundred total.)

**Lia**: *Salamat po! Punta ako **kay** Aling Bebang ngayon.* (Thank you! I’m going to Aling Bebang now.)

**Narrator**: Lia rushes off, knowing that the *palengke* is not only a place to buy goods but also a place where the community keeps an eye on things—and where natural, Predicate-Subject Tagalog flows freely.
