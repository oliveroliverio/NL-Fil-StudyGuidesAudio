**ChatGPT:**

Here’s the Filipino translation for your list:

* **swimming pool** – **palanguyan**
* **classroom** – **klasrum**
* **school** – **paaralan**
* **outside** – **labas**
* **garage** – **garahe**
* **neighborhood** – **kapitbahayan** / **barangay** (depending on context: “kapitbahayan” = neighborhood; “barangay” = the smallest political unit, often used like a neighborhood)
* **city** – **lungsod** / **syudad**
* **park** – **liwasan** / **parke**


👉 Notes:

* Both **“liwasan”** (native term) and **“parke”** (loanword from Spanish) are correct for “park,” with *parke* being more common in everyday use.
* For **outside**, you can also say **“sa labas”** if used in a sentence.
* For **school**, **paaralan** is the formal/standard term, though **eskuwela** (from Spanish “escuela”) is often heard in casual speech.


Do you want me to build these into an **Anki JSON payload (Basic cards)** like we’ve been doing, so you can import them directly?
