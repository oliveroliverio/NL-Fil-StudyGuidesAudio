# Bilang at Pamilang (Mag-Filipino Tayo 2nd editiion, pp. 61, 67-68, 77)

  ## Umawit Tayo!

 ******

 ## Bilang o Pamilang?

 ***Numbers*** (***Bilang)*** are basic in any culture. We state our age, birthday, height, weight, address, contact number, and how much money we have in the bank, or what is left in our credit account using the concept we call "numbers." Numbers are expressed in digits. To denote in words the concept or idea represented by the digit, we use a ***numeral (Pamilang)***.

 Interestingly, the Spanish language has remarkably enriched the Filipino number/numeral system to the point that counting, stating monetary value, and telling time and date are more popularly done using Spanish-based vocabulary than the Tagalog-based counterparts of said words.

 ## Mga Babasahin (Readings)

 For this lesson, refer to the following pages of Mag-Filipino Tayo 2nd edition:

  - Mga Pamilang na Filipino: p. 61;
 - Estruktura Bilang 1 - 100: pp. 67 -68; and
 - Pamilang na Espanyol: p. 77. **

# Gamit ng "Magkano?"

  ### Sa Palengke (In the Market)





 Ano ang nakikita mo? Ano ang maari mong marinig? (*What do you see? What may you possibly hear?)*

 Walk into a Philippine market and one of the most common questions you will hear is "**Magkano (po) ito?"**

 ***Magkano ***literally translates to "how much." Here are examples:

  - Magkano (po) ang saging? ----------> How much is the banana?
 - Magkano (po) ang mangga? --------> How much is the mango?
 - Magkano (po) ang sibuyas?---------> ?
 - Magkano (po) ang kamatis?--------->

 The mode of exchange (currency) in the Philippines is the peso (roughly equivalent to P57 to 1$). And since fruits and vegetables in the retail market are sold by the kilo (1 kilo = 2.2 lbs.), the expected answers are as follows:

  - [Saging]: P60.00 (po) isang kilo or Sesenta pesos (po) isang kilo.
 - [Mangga]: P100.00 (po) isang kilo or Isang daan (po) (ang) isang kilo
 - [Sibuyas]: P50 (po) kalahating kilo or Singkuwenta (po) (ang) kalahati (kalahating kilo).
 - [Kamatis]: P25 (po) (ang) kalahating kilo or Bente singko (po) (ang) kalahati (kalahating kilo).

 Eggs are sold by the dozen (dosena). In department stores, goods are sold by the piece.

 ### Magsanay tayo! (Let's practice!)

 With a partner, ask and answer questions using "magkano." You may focus on the other vegetables in the picture, or on other nouns you have learned this far. And, you are welcome to name any price you want!

  - jacket * pepper - **sili**
 - watch * garlic - **bawang**
 - umbrella * ginger - **luya**
 - kotse * oranges - **dalandan**
 - wall clock * squash - **kalabasa**
 - telepono * eggplant - **talong**
 - eyeglasses
 - chair
 - table
 - aklat/libro
 - eggs

 Tingnang mabuti ang nasa larawan. Ano ang ginagawa ng mga tauhan? (Look closely at what is in the picture. What are the characters doing? )



 ### Pakinggan ang sumusunod na diyalogo. Pansinin ang mga salitang naka-***bold***:

 [*Situation: Myra and Ester are good friends, and are enrolled in the same college. They chance upon each other in the school cafeteria.*]



 *Myrna*: Uy, Ester, ikaw ba iyan? Kumusta ka ***na***? (*How are you/How are you already?*)

 *Myrna*: Ayos ***pa*** rin naman ako. (*I'll still OK as well.*)

 *Ester*: May klase ka ***pa*** ba mamaya? (*Do you still have a class?*)

 *Myrna:* Wala ***na***. (*No more*) Kakatapos lang ng klase ko sa *Biloyohiya*. Uuwi ***na*** nga ako eh. (*My class in Biology is just over*. *I'm going home now.*)

  ### Sagutin sa Filipino ang mga sumusunod:

  1. Nasaan ang magkaibigan?
 2. Ano raw ang lagay ni Ester? Bakit? *[**lagay - state/conditio**n]*
 3. May klase pa ba si Myrna? Saan na daw siya pupunta?
 4. Ano ang gusto ni Ester na gawin nila ni Myrna? *[**gawin - to do*****]**
 5. Sino ang magbabayad ng kanilang kakainin? [***will be eaten*]**

   - #### Ano ang salin ng "na" sa Ingles?


 ## Dagdag na Gawain

  - In the Breakout room, you will work with a partner to answer any three of the questions above.
 - Back in the main session, you will be asked to share some or all of your answers to the whole class.

- **Nasaan ang magkaibigan?**  
    → Nasa canteen ang magkaibigan.
    
- **Ano raw ang lagay ni Ester? Bakit?**  
    → Pagod daw si Ester kasi marami siyang ginawa sa klase kanina.
    
- **May klase pa ba si Myrna? Saan na daw siya pupunta?**  
    → Wala na siyang klase. Pupunta raw siya sa canteen para kumain kasama si Ester.
    
- **Ano ang gusto ni Ester na gawin nila ni Myrna?**  
    → Gusto ni Ester na kumain muna sila at magpahinga sandali bago umuwi.
    
- **Sino ang magbabayad ng kanilang kakainin?**  
    → Si Myrna ang magbabayad dahil siya ang nagyayang kumain.
    
- **Balikan ang salin ng mga pangungusap na may naka-bold na salita:**
    
    - **Ano ang salin ng “pa” sa Ingles batay sa diyalogo?**  
        → Ang salin ng “pa” ay _still_ o _yet_, depende sa konteksto.
        
    - **Ano ang salin ng “na” sa Ingles?**  
        → Ang salin ng “na” ay _already_ o _now_, depende rin sa gamit sa pangungusap.

  ## "Pa" at "Na" sa Pangungusap

 One unique linguistic characteristic of the Filipino language is the use of *particles*. In previous lessons, we encountered the enclitic particles ***po/ho, daw, raw, din, rin*** and ***nga. ***In this lesson, we meet yet another pair of enclitic particles we encountered in the dialog above: "**Pa"** and "**Na."**

 These are little words that generally pertain to the time of a given action, although they can have other meanings.



 ### Mga Gawain

  1. Study how these particles are used. Ang Gamit ng Pa at Na, pahina 141 - 142, Mag-Filipino Tayo 2nd edition.*** ***
 2. **Role play: Breakout room** activity***. ****Assume that you and a friend chance upon each other at the walkway to the library or the Academic Success Center. What will your conversation be like? Use "pa" and "na" in your **short** dialog. You may use the dialog above as model.*

### PPT: Use of May and Mayroon/Meron

*What the word means:*

- The verb “may” or its alternant form “mayroon/meron” is equivalent to **“to have”** in English. It means that the actual possessor of an object is “in the sentence.”
  - Example 1: May kapatid si Andy. *(Andy has a sibling.)*
  - Example 2: Mayroong kapatid si Andy. *(Andy has a sibling.)*

- When the actual possessor is *not* in the sentence, “may” or “mayroon/meron” means **“there is/there are.”**
  - Example 1: May lalaki sa garahe. *(There’s a guy/man in the garage.)*
  - Example 2: May bagyo ngayon. *(There’s a storm now.)*

### PPT: Use of May and Mayroon/Meron


- **When to use May:**

- **May** is used with **nouns** [singular or plural, *with or without modifiers*], and **verbs**. 
  There should be no particle [ko, ka, po, ba, na, din, pala, etc.] between the noun or the verb and the word **may**.

  - Example 1: May **kapatid** [noun] si Andy.  
    *(Andy has a sibling.)*

  - Example 2: May **mabait na kapatid** [noun with modifier] si Andy.  
    *(Andy has a sibling.)*

  - Example 3: May **natutulog** [verb] sa sopa.  
    *(There is someone sleeping on the sofa.)*

### PPT: Use of May and Mayroon/Meron

- **When to use Mayroon/Meron**:

- Mayroon (Meron) is used before a **particle or a one-syllable word, a personal pronoun, or a demonstrative pronoun**.

  - Example 1: Mayroon/Meron **din** [particle/one syllable] ako niyan.
    - *(I also have that.)*

  - Example 2: Mayroon/Meron **siyang** [personal pronoun with ligature “ng”] pera.
    - *(He/She has money.)*

  - Example 3: Mayroon/Meron **itong** [demonstrative pronoun with ligature “ng”] pangalan.
    - *(This [object] has a name.)*


### PPT: Use of May and Mayroon/Meron

- **When to use May and Mayroon/Meron**
  
- May and Mayroon/Meron can be used to ask a yes/no question.
  - May pagkain ka ba? *(Do you have food?)*
  - Mayroon/Meron ka bang pagkain?
  - May klase ba bukas? *(Is there class tomorrow?)*
  - Mayroon bang klase bukas?

### PPT: Mayroon? o Wala?

- **May, Mayroon/Meron = There is/There are; To have**

- Observe how the words are used in questions and answers:
  - Mayroon/Meron ka bang kasama? *(Do you **have** a companion?)*
  - Oo, mayroon. *(Yes, I have.)*
  - Oo, mayroon/meron akong kasama. *(Yes, I **have** a companion.)*
  - May bagyo ba ngayon? *(Is **there** a storm now?)*
  - Oo. [Not: “Oo, may.”] *(Yes.)*
  - Oo, may bagyo ngayon. *(Yes, **there is** a storm now.)*

### PPT: Mayroon? o Wala?

- **Wala**  =  *None; To not have*
- Observe how the word is used in answers to questions:
- Question: Mayroon/Meron bang tinapay? _(Is there bread?)_
- Answer 1: Wala. _(None.)_
- Answer 2: Wala po. _(None, Sir/Ma’am.)_
- Answer 3: Wala, walang tinapay. _(No, there is no bread.)_

 ### Panimula

 What time is it on the clock in the picture above? How do we say the time in Filipino?

 In the last Aralin [Lesson], we visited/revisited numerals in Filipino, with focus on Tagalog-based numerals. Do you remember the specific uses of these numerals in common, everyday interactions among Filipinos?

 ### Mga Layunin

 In this lesson, we take a thoughtful look at Filipino numerals based on Spanish. At the end of the lesson, you should be able to:

  - commit to memory Spanish-based Filipino numbers and numerals; and
 - tell time and rank using both Filipino-based and Spanish-based numerals.

 ### Mga Babasahín at Pagsasanay (Readings & Practice)

 For a starter, please refer to the Vocabulary List, pp 76-77 of the 2nd edition.

 From there, proceed to pp. 85 of the 2nd edition.

  - Read the short discussion and study the examples on how to tell time in Filipino using the Filipino time marker ***ika*** and the Spanish marker ***ala-*** or ***alas-. ***
 - This done, now you are ready to practice using your newly acquired vocabulary. Do Pagsasanay A, B, and C on page 86. ******
 - For further practice, try *Mga Gawain* A and B, p. 86 to prepare you to work with a partner in class.

 **Additional Resource:**

 ***Ordinal**** **Numbers***. These numbers are used for rank or order and these can be expressed in two forms by using affixes ***ika-*** or ***pang-*** (pam-/ pan-). ***Pang-*** and ***ika-*** are both common for the first twenty ordinals. For higher ordinals, ***ika*** is common. ***Pang/Pang-/Pan*** is rarely used.

 *Ordinal Numbers*

  1. **Pang-ilan** kang anak? (Which child are you?)

 **Pangatlo** ako. (I am the third child.)

  2. Ikaw **ba** ang panganay? (Are you the first child/eldest?)

 Hindi. Ako ang bunso. ( No. I am the youngest.)

  3. **Anong oras ang klase mo**? (What time is your class?)

 **Alas-dos** ng hapon ang klase ko. (My class is at 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon.)

# Breakout: Magkuwentuhan tayo! (Let's talk!/Let's share stories!)



 ## Rasyonal (Rationale)

 Conversations, whether casual or serious, have been recognized by research as a powerful avenue for both language learning and knowledge development. But the value of the dialog as a communication tool is not a new concept. "Socrates believed that the way to find answers and attain knowledge was through the practice of conversation" (awkwardsilence.com.au/blog/socrates). Contemporary scholars now call this tool "interpersonal communication."

 Casual, everyday conversations can flow smoothly through question and answer. In all situations, both parties have to engage in attentive listening. Depending on the context of the dialog, both parties are expected to come out more informed and smarter at the end of the dialog, but also sometimes more confused. But again, the confusion may be threshed out in another dialog.

 ## Gawain (Activity)

 Today [Tuesday], you will have some free time to chat in the breakout room. Here are some points to guide you.

  - You and your partner will take a specific role: Student A or Student B.
 - Begin your conversation with "*Kumusta?*"
 - Your conversation may revolve around personal matters, and anything on Filipino culture.
 - Your conversation will be in ***Filipino***, or ***will*** ***mostly be in Filipino***.
 - Use question words we have studied this far: ***Ano (Ano-ano), Sino (Sino-sino), Alin, Taga-saan, Saan, Nasaan, Ilan/Ilang taon /Ilang beses, May, Mayroon/Meron; Question using "ba," ***or ***other question*** words you are familiar with.
 - You will spend 10 minutes with your partner. Should we have more time, you may be paired up with a second partner.
 - Make the most of your time in the breakout room to practice whatever you have learned this far.
 - End your conversation with "*Paalam/Adyos/Babay*" and other leave-taking clauses.

# Filipino-American History Month Special: Meet Modesto "Larry" Itliong



 October is Filipino-American History month. This month was chosen for this singular celebration, which began in 2009, to commemorate the first recorded presence of Filipinos in what will later be named as the United States.

 History has it that on October 18, 1587, a galleon (Spanish ship involved in the trade between Asia through Manila, Philippines, and Spain through Acapulco, Mexico) landed in what is now called Morro Bay, California. The ship was *Nuestra Señora de Buena Esperanza *which was then commissioned to sail from Portugal-controlled Macau en route to Acapulco, Mexico. The crew stayed in or around Morro Bay only for three days, before sailing on to Acapulco. The next recorded arrival of Filipinos in the United States after the Morro Bay incident was in 1595 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_of_the_first_FilipinosLinks to an external site.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_of_the_first_Filipinos)).

 After the Morro Bay story, Filipinos would pour into the United States in at least four waves. Many of them acquired US citizenship, and significantly invested in the advancement of this country. Among these egalitarian Filipino-Americans is Modesto "Larry" Itliong.

 Here are two resources for your leisurely review. There are no assignments linked to them!
