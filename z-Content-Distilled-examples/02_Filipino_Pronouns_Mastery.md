# Filipino Pronouns Mastery

## 1. Personal Pronouns (Panghalip Panao)
Filipino pronouns change form depending on their role in the sentence (Subject, Possessive, or Oblique).

### A. "Ang" Set (Subject / Topic)
Used as the **subject** of the sentence (the one doing the action in Actor-Focus verbs, or the topic in descriptions).

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st Person** | **Ako** (I) | **Kami** (We - Exclusive)<br>**Tayo** (We - Inclusive) |
| **2nd Person** | **Ikaw / Ka** (You) | **Kayo** (You all) |
| **3rd Person** | **Siya** (He/She) | **Sila** (They) |

> **Note:** *Ikaw* is used at the beginning of a sentence or alone. *Ka* is used after the verb/predicate.
> *   *Ikaw ay maganda.* (Formal)
> *   *Maganda ka.* (Natural)

### B. "Ng" Set (Possessive / Actor)
Used to show **ownership** OR as the **actor** in Object-Focus sentences.

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st Person** | **Ko** (My / I) | **Namin** (Our - Excl)<br>**Natin** (Our - Incl) |
| **2nd Person** | **Mo** (Your / You) | **Ninyo** (Your / You all) |
| **3rd Person** | **Niya** (His/Her / He/She) | **Nila** (Their / They) |

*   **Possession:** *Ito ang libro **ko**.* (This is **my** book.)
*   **Actor (Object Focus):** *Kinain **ko** ang mansanas.* (**I** ate the apple.)

### C. "Sa" Set (Oblique / Directional)
Used to indicate **direction**, **location**, or **possession** (when emphasizing "Mine", "Yours"). Used with prepositions like *para sa* (for), *galing sa* (from).

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st Person** | **Akin** (Me / Mine) | **Amin** (Us - Excl)<br>**Atin** (Us - Incl) |
| **2nd Person** | **Iyo** (You / Yours) | **Inyo** (You all / Yours) |
| **3rd Person** | **Kanya** (Him/Her / His/Hers) | **Kanila** (Them / Theirs) |

*   **Direction:** *Ibigay mo ito sa **akin**.* (Give this to **me**.)
*   **Possession (Emphatic):** *Sa **akin** ito.* (This is **mine**.)

## 2. Inclusive vs. Exclusive "We"
This is a unique feature of Tagalog.
*   **Tayo (Inclusive):** Includes the listener. "You and I" (and maybe others).
    *   *Kain tayo.* (Let's eat - inviting you to eat with me.)
*   **Kami (Exclusive):** Excludes the listener. "Me and them" (but not you).
    *   *Kumain kami.* (We ate - I ate with someone else, you were not there.)

## 3. Demonstrative Pronouns (Panghalip Pamatlig)
These point to specific objects based on distance from the speaker and listener.

| Distance | Pronoun (This/That) | Location (Here/There) | Modifier (This/That + Noun) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Near Speaker** | **Ito** (This) | **Dito / Rito** (Here) | **Itong** |
| **Near Listener** | **Iyan** (That) | **Diyan / Riyan** (There) | **Iyang** |
| **Far from Both** | **Iyon** (That over there) | **Doon / Roon** (Over there) | **Iyong** |

### Examples:
*   **Ito:** *Ano **ito**?* (What is **this**? - holding it)
*   **Iyan:** *Ano **iyan**?* (What is **that**? - pointing to something you are holding)
*   **Iyon:** *Ano **iyon**?* (What is **that**? - pointing to something far away)

### Dito vs Rito (D vs R Rule)
*   Use **D** if the preceding word ends in a consonant.
    *   *Mainit **d**ito.* (It's hot here.)
*   Use **R** if the preceding word ends in a vowel.
    *   *Pumunta ka **r**ito.* (Come here.)

## 4. Linking Pronouns
When connecting demonstratives to nouns, use linkers (-ng / na).

*   **Itong** libro (This book) = *Ito + -ng + libro*
*   **Iyang** bag (That bag) = *Iyan + -ng + bag*
*   **Iyong** bahay (That house yonder) = *Iyon + -ng + bahay*

*Example Sentence:*
*   *Mahal **itong** relo.* (This watch is expensive.)
