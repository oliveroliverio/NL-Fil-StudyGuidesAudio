  Isang maligaya at mapagpalang linggo muli ang bati ko sa inyong lahat! (Another joyous and blessed week is my greeting to you all !)

  - review basic Tagalog-based and Spanish-based numerals
 - tell time and date using Tagalog-based and Spanish-based vocabulary;
 - use possessive pronouns in phrases and sentences to answer the question ***Kanino***;
 - engage in a free conversation in Filipino with an assigned partner: [Magkuwentuhan tayo! (Let's talk!/Let's share stories!)](https://swccd.instructure.com/courses/79165/pages/magkuwentuhan-tayo-lets-talk-slash-lets-share-stories);
 - meet Modesto "Larry" Itliong; and
 - continue nurturing the dynamic learning community now working productively in class!

 ### Paalaala

  - There is a *Learning Quiz on Possessive Pronouns/Possessive Adjectives in Week 10;*
 - Two (2) *Practice Activities* are due this week.
 - The *Gratitude Journal* is back!
 - And . . . The *Cultural Event Reflection Journal *is due this Friday.
 - October is Filipino-American History Month! In a special way, this celebration "honors the history, pursuits, accomplishments, and legacy of Filipinos in the United States. It also serves to provide a link between Filipinos in the U.S. and Filipinos in the Philippines by showcasing their shared culture and heritage." This week [If you have not done so yet], please take a moment to view and listen to the [Filipino-American History Month Special: Meet Modesto "Larry" Itliong.](https://swccd.instructure.com/courses/79165/pages/filipino-american-history-month-special-meet-modesto-larry-itliong)





 ***You can do these!/Kaya mo ito!/Sí se puede!***

  It's still Filipino American History Month. Here's another event you may consider attending. Sorry for the late notice, but I got it only on October 26.
