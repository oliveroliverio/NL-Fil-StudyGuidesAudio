# ChatGPT Conversation

**ChatGPT:**

Construct a short story with dialog that's tests my understanding of the following markdown for a Filipino Lesson.  Ask the reader questions in the story to get the person engaged and make learning the language and concepts fun.  I'll forward you the markdown in a bit.  But let me know other things I should add in this prompt for effective language learning based on text/markdown content of notes containing terminology, vocabulary, greetings, nouns, and noun markers

---

**ChatGPT:**

Got it — you’ll be forwarding me some Filipino lesson markdown later. To make sure I can turn that into a fun short story with dialog that tests your understanding, it’ll help if you include a few extra details in your prompt up front. Here’s what I suggest adding:


## What to Include in Your Prompt for Effective Language Learning



1. **Content Scope** * Whether the markdown contains **vocabulary lists**, **greetings**, **nouns and noun markers**, **sample sentences**, or **grammar notes**. * If there are **themes** (e.g., family, school, food, travel) — so I can weave them into the story.
2. **Difficulty Level** * Beginner, intermediate, or advanced. * Should I mostly use simple phrases like *Magandang umaga* and *Ako si Oliver*? Or should I also test longer sentences with noun markers like *Ang aso ay nasa bahay*?
3. **Engagement Style** * Do you want the story to: * Feel like a **roleplay** (you’re a character interacting)? * Be more like a **narrative** with occasional questions? * Or a **quiz-style conversation** inside the story?
4. **Question Style** * Multiple choice? (Good for drilling vocab) * Fill-in-the-blank? (Great for grammar + noun markers) * Open-ended “What does this mean?” style?
5. **Mix of English and Filipino** * Should I blend English and Filipino (code-switching) to ease comprehension? * Or keep Filipino in the story, with questions in English?
6. **Reinforcement Techniques** * Repetition of new words in different contexts. * Ask the reader to **translate back and forth** (“How would you say ‘dog’ in Filipino?”). * Short recap at the end of the story to lock in the terms.



👉 When you send me the markdown, if you include those details in your prompt, I’ll be able to make a **fun, dialog-driven story** where characters use the target vocabulary and grammar, and the reader gets little “quiz moments” inside the flow.
Would you like me to draft a **template prompt** you can reuse for any Filipino lesson markdown you want to turn into a story+quiz?

here's the transcript (rather than a markdown lesson).  Can you see the entirety of this?  It's kind of large (2 hours worth of text).  Note, time stamps are in here.  Would it be helpful if I removed them?

 That you can do on your own.
 So… Here are our objectives for this week.
 Sa ating panimula, or introduction, ikalabin lima, hanggang ikadaluam po ng sitiembre dalawang Libot, dalawang put lima.
 Ang sinasaklaw ng ating pangapat or ikaapat na lingo.

 At the end of this week, you should be able to reinforce skills on the use of ANO and SINO.
 Ask and answer NASA and questions, name days, months, and other time markers, recognize unpronouns and use them in sentences, develop or reinforce skills in introducing oneself, a friend, or a family member, and, of course, continue building bridges towards the creation of a learning community.
 Our ultimate objective for this week is bullet number
 develop or reinforce skills in introducing oneself, a friend, or a family member. So…
 You should be able to create a dialogue today in the breakout room.
 A dialogue to introduce somebody based on a given picture.
 But to be able to do that, we will be needing the, the skill on the use of pronouns.
 And, of course, we would be going over, the lessons on… more… the lesson on more nouns to be able to reinforce our ability to speak the language. So, days and months would fall under…
 nouns and noun markers, the lesson that we had last week. Nasan is connected to nouns and noun markers, ano ancino.
 Are connected to nouns and noun markers.
 And, well, initially here, because I prepared this, I think several days back.

 Any lesson from last week, which you remember right now, on your toes.
 Yes.
 Oh, Kate… The dialogue from the photos… okay, maraming salamat.
 Yes, anything else?
 So, in the dialogue, what were you expected to use?

Adriana Gomez: Greetings! Like, good morning!
 That's magareim, Maramin Salama, Adriana!
 Ahma, anything else?
 Yes, Oliver?
 Yeah, okay, maraming salamat, Oliver! So… Omega?
 Hapon. Kabi.
 Tanghali, tama.
 So, babating mo ang isang tao, isa-sama mo ang…
 ang parte ng araw. You greet somebody, of course, you inject, or you bring in the part of the day, or the time of the day. Araming salamat. Anything else?
 Is there anything else? What was the… yes, okay, Jessica, tama? Sina. Anupa ang kasama ng sina? Ang, yes, and Kate, ang mga. So, completo na. These are the four ang…
 noun markers see, sina, ang, and ang mga. You will go back to that today as we go over the two bullets in our objectives.
 So… In addition, I mean.
 You know, in, in oral communication, In common everyday exchanges.
 The most common question to ask is, ano.
 Okay, so, anom… and sino, sino, si. We'll practice these two question words later today.
 But first, let's connect to see, sina, ang, and manga, and we use the question word nasa'an to be able to practice on those.
 So, nasaan, what does that mean in English?

Leticia Conway: Where?
 Where? Very good. And if you ask, using the question word nasaan, let's put it right up at this point, let's see what should come after that. So.
 Let's go to pages
 Pages
 Okay, I'm on page

Leticia Conway: And I have two tables here.
 The first part of the table says NASA unquestions, and the second part says NASA responses. So first, let's look at the NASA unquestions to be able to answer the question I posited before we proceeded to page
 The question was, what is Nassan used with, or what part of speech
 do we associate NASA Anu with? So let's look at the questions. Please unmute so we can all read aloud and hear ourselves.
 Okay, are you ready to read? Everybody say Inasa'an.

Katelyn Kingsbury: NASA.

Bryan Isidro: God.
 Yes, very good. Nasa Ansi, Jennifer, go.
 nasaan sila June at Dulor.

Katelyn Kingsbury: Nice.

Leticia Conway: And I don't.

Shannel Cortez: Glory.
 Nasaan ang laibigan mo.

Leticia Conway: And I'm diabetic.

Anna Cerrone: ain't…
 Nasaan ang mga aklat niya.

Leticia Conway: And a song.
 Okay.
 So the question word comes at the beginning of the sentence. Very much like in English, where is, where are… and so here you go. Nasaan, what comes right after nasaan?

Leticia Conway: Always.

Caesar Williams: That word?

Caesar Williams: Yeah, Jesse.
 First example, please.

Jessica: Hey, Jenny French.

Caesar Williams: D.
 One more time.

Jessica: See, changes things.
 See, Jennifer, Ama! And in the second example, Chanel, what comes right after Nazam?

Shannel Cortez: Sinajoon at the Lord.
 Maraming salamat.
 So… C, Sina. You will recognize them as markers of what do C and Sina mark again? Sean?
 C, Sina would mark what?
 What part of speech?
 What about Samantha?

Leticia Conway: Step pronouns?
 What about Josh? Would you be able to recall C? What comes after C?
 What comes after Sina?
 What part of speech?
 Cheers.

Leticia Conway: None.
 Yes, Josh?

Joshua Nelson: Did you say after?
 Yes, after.

Joshua Nelson: huh?
 No.
 Yeah, what kind of now?

Joshua Nelson: Wrong now?

Joshua Nelson: Or…
 Okay, maybe we can…

Joshua Nelson: Copper now?
 Very good. Very good, proper, proper.
 So, Jennifer starts with an uppercase J, June is the name of a person, Dolor is the name of a person. So, C and Sina would mark proper nouns. Let's look at the last two examples. What word comes right after nasa'an?
 Letty?

Leticia Conway: Ang?
 Okay, right, and the word after that?

Leticia Conway: I begin.
 Okay, so you have a noun phrase, ang kaibigan.
 And what part of speech is Kaibigan?

Leticia Conway: It's the pronoun?
 Mmm… almost.
 Joey, what part of speech is Kai Vegan?
 What about DJ?
 Ehh.

Dj  S. Pedronan: Anybody?
 Oh, sorry, DJ?

Dj  S. Pedronan: Hello, is my bike?
 Yeah, we can hear you loud and clear enough.

Dj  S. Pedronan: What was the question again?
 Oh, what was the question?
 Okay, Brian, are you ready to answer the question?

Bryan Isidro: In Depot.
 Oh, Arnold?

Arnold Cruz: Is it a common noun?
 Common noun! Excellent! Thank you so much, Arnold. So, kaibigan is a common noun. And what number is it, Arnold?
 Number, plural or singular?

Arnold Cruz: Singular.
 It's singular, that's right. And let's look at the last entry. You have nasaan ang mga aklat nya. Ang mga aklat comes right after nasaan. Now, what kind of noun is ang mga klat, and what is the number, Michelle?

Michelle Evans: Or no, sorry, plural, common noun?
 Aha, common noun, plural, very good, okay? So, now we are able to see that Nasa'an
 Is the appropriate question word when we are looking for a person?
 Or, I think.
 Person, maybe one or more than one thing, maybe one or more than one.
 So, nasa'an.
 Nasan, remember that.
 Why am I emphasizing this? Because there's another question word that's… that translates also to where, and that is saun. But sa'an has its own function. It's not used.
 To locate a person, not used to locate an object.
 It's used to locate something else.
 Okay, so let's put this in mind right now. Now, how do we answer NASA Anne questions? Let's look at
 A, the NASA in question, and its connection to B, the NASA responses. Now, I would like to ask Arnold again to please read the first question, Arnold.

Arnold Cruz: Nasa Ansi Jennifer.
 Maraming salamat. And DJ, please read the first response.

Dj  S. Pedronan: NASA Baji, see Jennifer.
 Very good, DJ. So, Nasaam?
 NASA.
 please remember that partnership, or that connection. I would like to ask,
 Elijah, to please read the second question.

Elijah O. Guanzon: Nasaan sin at danong.
 Okay, and Elijah, the response is still yours, Anna.
 Please read it aloud.

Elijah O. Guanzon: Nasa… nasa Filipinas, sin najun at the lor.
 Yes, very good. We are now with the third question. Anna, would you be able to do it?

Anna Cerrone: Nasaan ang calig… Could be… I have a hard time saying that one.
 That's fine, okay. There are…

Anna Cerrone: Kai?
 Okay. Kaibigan.

Anna Cerrone: Egan, okay, cabbie, cabby Egan?
 Okay, that's almost… we're almost there. And please read the response, Anna.

Anna Cerrone: NASA.

Anna Cerrone: Pa'arel and heavy vegan, Nicole.
 Okay, Kaibigan, yeah, that's right. Brian, the last question, please.

Bryan Isidro: Asaan ang mga aklat niya.
 And the response, Brian?

Bryan Isidro: Nasa mesa ang mga aklatnya.
 Okay, very good. So, when answering a NASAAN question, what word is required in your response class? Please look at the examples.

Leticia Conway: And that's… And that's something.
 Okay, yeah, you have to have NASA.
 NASA.
 And if you are… I mean, if you look at the responses in here in English.
 You will notice that there is a rough translation of NASA.

Fir Selag: Jennifer…
 See, Jennifer!
 is… There seems to be no single word translating that is in there.
 at home with the NASA Baha'i.
 Okay? At home, NASA Baha. In the Philippines, NASA, Filipinas. In school, NASA paralan. On the table, NASA Mesa. So NASA should be followed by a location, the place where the object is. Oliver, I see your hand up, and I go.

Oliver O: Is the subject always at the end of the sentence when answering Nasa An questions?
 I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch the first part of the question.

Oliver O: Is the, subject always at the end of the sentence for NASA responses?
 Okay, very good.
 question.
 There are two possible ways by which you may answer this question.
 So, you may begin with the subject.
 You may begin by saying, see, Jennifer? Let me write that down.
 So, oops, I can say… C. Jennifer I. Nassa Bahai.
 Okay.
 And the word order would be, see Jennifer does the subject, I is the linker, and nasabahai is the location, that's the predicate. The word order that's used in our examples is the other way, the regular way, the normal way in the Filipino language.
 Nasabahai Si Jennifer. And what is the sentence word order? Predicate plus subject.
 Okay? So please remember that in the Filipino, in normal speech in Filipino, predicate subject is used.
 But subject plus predicate is correct also, except that it's considered to be a little too formal in overall communication. Thank you for raising that point, Oliver. It's one, you know, you're one step ahead of our lessons. Okay, any other questions?
 All right, so if you use the subject at the beginning of the sentence, what little word do you need?
 To connect the subject to the predicate class.
 Something that you don't see in the predicate subject pattern.
 Look at this.

Arnold Cruz: Is it I?
 Aye, correct, that's right. So, if you use… oh, sorry. If you use the subject plus predicate pattern, see Jennifer, I, NASA, bye.
 The I, you are required to use the I. If you use the predicate.
 plus subject pattern, you are not required to use I at all. You don't say, nasa ay bahay, see Jennifer, or nasa bahay, I see Jennifer.
 Okay, any other questions?
 So, we have formulated one generalization. NASA'an is responded with… Nasa.
 phrase, so…
 every time you answer a NASA and question, you always need to use the NASA phrase, okay? And you are going to indicate the location of what? A person or a thing, or persons and things.
 Okay, any questions? And we would like to add the third generalization. There is another way by which we may put together our words in a sentence.
 We may use the subject plus predicate pattern, which is the reverse of the pattern that we have in our examples.
 Okay, I'm going down the page…
 And I'm going down to page
 In your textbooks.
 you know, you have the same thing, same page, and let's look at letter D, question and answer.
 So, when you are indicating the location of something or someone, you need a noun. You need a noun, okay? So, what noun do we have in the first picture? I hope everybody is able to see my page.
 I have
 So, first, we identified the place.
 the place that is… that we should be using to respond to this, question and answer activity. So, what place do we see in the first picture? Fair?

Leticia Conway: Sweet.

Fir Selag: Swimming pool.
 Okay, swimming pool. Okay, na rin ng swimming pool, sabhimung na sa swimming pool siya. But there's a word, a Filipino word, to refer to swimming pool, and that would come from the word langoi. To swim is lumangoi, and swimming pool would be…
 Pa, la, mu yan.
 Okay, so that would be swimming pool.
 Okay, I think we know where the teacher is. We have this word.
 the word that identifies this concept in our, list of loan words. You remember the word?
 Where's the teacher?

Leticia Conway: Esquelahan.
 Specifically. Spec… in any specific place.
 Last hole, where the teacher is.

Leticia Conway: Clase.

Leticia Conway: Nasa Clase.
 Okay, maybe.
 Anyone else, please raise your hand if you want to participate.
 Anyone? Okay, you remember the loanword?
 Oops.

Leticia Conway: Escuelajan, or Clase?

Leticia Conway: Oh, anaphaba.
 Okay, class, do you remember the word classroom?
 Okay, yeah, so this is what we are going to do. Go over the pictures and see if you're able to identify the place where the person or the object is.
 I'm going to give you
 Please raise your hand if you want to participate, or if you want to say something.
 Okay.
 So, have you seen any picture, the term in Filipino for which we're not familiar with?

Leticia Conway: Oh, the one…
 Please raise your hand if you want to participate.
 Anyone?
 No, lajar a la ninoja? Okay, so let…

Leticia Conway: I don't know where…
 Yes, Leti, take your hand off, get your hand off.

Leticia Conway: Oh, I… I don't know where… The riding horse place.
 Okay, so anyone who knows the term for this.
 It's not a garden, but maybe we can identify it to be in the… Oh, okay.

Leticia Conway: Brunch?
 Stress is on the first syllable…

Adriana Gomez: Param, like a metal?
 Yep, okay, that's right. Parang. Meadow. Parang.
 Okay? What about… what about here? Sean, what about in this picture?
 For the cards.
 Sean?
 Adriana?
 Samantha?

Adriana Gomez: Got sick!

Adriana Gomez: Cage? I don't know, garage? I don't know how to say cage.
 Oh, okay, garage. Garage is… Garage? Garage. Okay, maraming salamat.
 So… This is what we're going to do.
 We are going to do a little practice in the breakout room. You're going to ask each other NASA An questions, and you're… based on these pictures, and you're going to respond using an adverb of place introduced by the word NASA. For example, let's try…
 One practice. Let's do one practice, rather. So, I would like you to see this… this image.
 Okay…
 The question, the lead question is nasaan ang, because puno is a common noun. So, I would say, or I would ask, nasaan ang puno. Anyone who's ready to answer my question?
 Nasa ng puno.

Leticia Conway: NASA Kalier?
 Please raise your hand if you want to participate. Yes, Leti?

Leticia Conway: Nasa Kalye, I guess?
 And that's…

Leticia Conway: Kanye?
 Is the… is the tree on the street?

Leticia Conway: Oh, no.
 Anyone else? Anyone else who can tell us where it is?

Leticia Conway: Oh, I sunbath.
 Yeah, two hands are up, I hope I'm able to see your hand. So, yeah, okay. Yeah, MJ.

MJ Seapno: Lewassan or Parquet?
 Okay, maybe, so complete your… complete your response.
 Please complete your refund and pay.
 So, MJ, nasaan ang puno.

MJ Seapno: I don't know, Parque or Lewassan, out of the two?
 Okay, so let's write your sentence down. So please use a noun marker for puno.
 An appropriate noun marker for Puno would be…
 We are a little formal here.
 So, what is the noun marker, for puno?
 MJ.
 Is it ang, C, or Sina?

MJ Seapno: in the picture, because Ang Manga is, like, more and more trees, right?
 Sure.

MJ Seapno: Justina?

MJ Seapno: So it's Sina.
 Okay, so would Sina be appropriate?
 Help?
 Please. Lifeline fare, would soon not be appropriate?
 Fair.

Fir Selag: Oh, okay, it's gonna be… Hang.
 Mmm, okay, that's right.

MJ Seapno: Oh.
 Oh,
 So we say, an uno. Now finish your sentence, MJ.

MJ Seapno: Ang puno ay nasa.

MJ Seapno: The WhatsApp?

MJ Seapno: or slide, or Parquet…
 Okay, if you want to use Parque, maybe it's at the park. Ang puno ang nasa Liwasan, correct?
 Okay? So that's exactly what you're going to do when you are in the breakout room.
 Student
 So, shall we… Lordy, what are we doing in the breakout room?
 Lordy?

Lordisel Reyes: Question.
 Chanel, what are we doing? Yeah, okay, can you be more specific about that, Anna?

Lordisel Reyes: S squared.
 Using what question word?

Lordisel Reyes: Nessa on.
 Okay, and then…

Lordisel Reyes: And then he answered with NASA.
 Okay, and what would be the basis of the questions and the answers?
 Of course… basis would be, Gavin?

Gavin Meza: Sorry, cut out, could you repeat that?
 Okay, what would be the basis of the questions and the answers?

Gavin Meza: We would ask where,

Gavin Meza: each word is, and then we would give an answer to the location of where they are in Tagal.
 Okay? And we base our questions and answers on the pictures that we are looking at right now, okay? So…
 You have to have your books, because I cannot share this in the chat.
 So, let me stop. Yes, fair.

Fir Selag: Do we have to answer all
 I'll give you time, like
 Okay?
 It… does that answer your question fair?

Fir Selag: Oh, yes, thank you.
 Okay, well, no man, so I'll stop sharing now.
 And I'll put you in breakout rooms.
 And…
 Okay, as soon as you get to your breakout room, please greet each other, bang happen, and then assign yourself a role. Are you student
 There's… I mean, you should take turns in asking.
 questions.
 So the rooms are open now.
 There is one room where there are three participants.
 Cesar, go to room number

Caesar Williams: I don't have any,

Caesar Williams: invite to go to it. I keep on lagging out, so when you probably invited me, it refreshed it.
 I… I… I grouped everybody, I… I mean, I put you in the room when I put everybody in.
 So… And I'm looking at my…
 My breakout room, schedule right now, and your name is there.

Caesar Williams: I do not have, or I…
 Maybe you should be… you should refresh on it.

Caesar Williams: Okay.
 Fresh, maybe. Not me. You.
 Hello there, mga anak.
 Is there any item, any picture you struggled with?

MJ Seapno: the… the Evan picture, nice.
 Evan, okay, let's look at the picture of Evan. Oh, yeah, okay, that's a very interesting point. Oops, that, that, so it's here.
 Okay, and… well… Let me see…
 I went into a room where there was a very interesting exchange in regard to that.
 Who can share his or her answer to the event picture?
 Was it… Arnold?

Arnold Cruz: Oh yeah, for…
 Okay, so Arnold, please?

Arnold Cruz: Yeah, we said, NASA banqueta?

Arnold Cruz: Let's see, Evan?
 Okay, that's right. So, in response to nasa ansevan, nasa banqueta se even. And banqueta Arnold would in English be…

Arnold Cruz: sidewalk.
 Okay, very good. So, one added vocabulary. Salamat anak. Any other, picture you had some difficulty with?
 And I'm talking to the class.
 Walana?
 Oh…

MJ Seapno: Love, bro.
 Walana. Tao Photo Location. Okay, Tao, yes. So let's look at one more picture. Tao, to the left of…
 to the left of Evan.
 So anyone who has an answer to this, to the question, NASA, and… oh, by the way, do we ask.
 Nasaan ang tao, or nasan ang mga tao?

MJ Seapno: Ang mga.
 Okay, that's right. Asa ng mga tao, and what would be the appropriate response? I'm asking for a volunteer.
 Look at their legs, look at their position.
 What are they doing?
 Okay, so Anna has an answer in English.
 Anyone who can put that into Filipino.

MJ Seapno: Kalier?
 Oh.
 Okay, or… Christine has the verb…
 Christine has the verb for that, but we're looking for the location of the people. So, street can be Calier.
 Okay, so anyone who can put that into a response, into a complete sentence.
 Ang tanong, nasaan ang mga tao. Any response?
 Okay, fair?

Fir Selag: And I was, oh, okay, let me repeat. Ang mga tao ay naglalakad sa calzada.
 Okay, ang mga tao aye.
 NASA calcada.
 Okay? Ang mga tao ay nasa kalsada. Your response ang mga tao ay naglalakad sa kalsada is correct also, no question about that. It's just that our focus for now is the persons, and not what they are doing.
 Okay? So, ang mga tao ay nasa kalsa, or ang mga tao ay nasa kay. Magaling, magaling. Let's give each one a round of applause. So, nasaan with…
 common noun, a proper noun, and in identifying, I mean, in responding to the question, we use si, sina, ang, ang mga, and then we cite a location.
 Okay.
 Months and days… months of the week… of the year and days of the months are also nouns. And so, we take a look at,
 how they are named in Filipino, to be able to add more to our vocabulary.
 Oh, but tap here…
 All right.
 These are the months of the year in Filipino. I'd like you to go over them, and let me know if anything sounds foreign to you.
 Anything that sounds unfamiliar?

Leticia Conway: Question, teacher.
 Oh, yes, lady?

Leticia Conway: I listened to, to the video.

Leticia Conway: And is it the first day of the week is Lingo?
 Right.

Leticia Conway: Oh, okay.
 Okay, all that is called… I mean, that, that is not fixed universally, because there are some countries where Monday is the first day of the week. Monday is identified as the first day of the week, but in the United States, Sunday is identified as the first day of the week.

Leticia Conway: Oh, okay.

Leticia Conway: Thank you.
 Walang ano man. So, any… anything about the months that sounds foreign to you, wala, kung wala, then I will ask somebody to read aloud. Any volunteer to please read the first

Leticia Conway: Right?

Adriana Gomez: No.

Jessica: Beautiful.

Adriana Gomez: Febrero.

Jessica: Oh.

Adriana Gomez: March, so…
 All right. Ramin Salama.

Adriana Gomez: Jessica?
 Okay, Esperanza, the next

Esperanza Corpus: Abril?

Esperanza Corpus: Mayo Juno.
 Maraming salamat, Caesar, the next

Caesar Williams: Julio?

Caesar Williams: Or… Augusto?

Caesar Williams: Si tiembre? Si tiembre?
 Okay, Samantha, the last
 Josh, the last

Joshua Nelson: Tubre?

Joshua Nelson: No biiembre.

Joshua Nelson: December.
 Okay, maraming salamat. In the Philippines, the tiembre Octubre and nubbiembre and disiembre are referred to as the burr months, since all of them end in burr, and they are also referred to as the Christmas Months.
 So, Christmas in the Philippines starts as early as September. I mean, the celebration itself.
 Okay, so, any… any questions?
 If you know your Spanish.
 names for months, then you should not be lost in naming the Philippine… naming the months in Filipino.
 The only difference would be in terms of some, some spelling characteristics. For example, Pebrero is spelled with a P, we don't use the F in here.
 Okay? And I think all the rest would be very similar to Spanish. Se tiembre. In Filipino, we don't say sep tiembre, but we say set tiembre.
 Now, what is month in Filipino, mga anag?
 What is month in Filipino?

Leticia Conway: One.
 Buando, okay, maraming salamat.
 The word one… It's also used for another concept.
 And it's used for that thing that lights up your evenings.
 Making it romantic.
 And what is that?

Dj  S. Pedronan: Come on.
 Okay, of course. So, so, one, that is… boon.
 Okay, so months in Filipino would be buen. The moon in Filipino would also be buon.
 No change in spelling, no change in pronunciation.
 It's just the context that will dictate to you what word you are referring to, what concept you're referring to. Let's move down now to araw, mga araw ng lingo.
 Okay, and let's…
 Go to our singer for now, singers for now. If you're familiar with the song, please sing along.
 So please get ready with your voices, singing voices.
 Yes, very slow.
 Sabato!

Leticia Conway: Ling alone.
 Saladol!

Leticia Conway: bundle.
 Nope.

Leticia Conway: No.
 I'll be…

Leticia Conway: Salvador!

Leticia Conway: Oh, no.
 Any more?
 And…
 Okay.

Leticia Conway: Nice.
 If you are familiar with Spanish vocabulary, then the names of the days in Filipinos should not be strangers to you.
 We say lingo, and then the day after lingo would be… What's it?

Leticia Conway: Amen.
 Charlene Guo. Dj?

Dj  S. Pedronan: Oh, boy.
 Okay, what's the day after Lingo, DJ?

Dj  S. Pedronan: Lunes.
 Okay, maraming salamat. And, Josh, what's the day after Lunes?

Joshua Nelson: Mark Case…
 Okay, salamat! And after Martaz as Pear… This vehicle.

Esperanza Corpus: Miercoles?
 Oh, right, that's right. And after miraculous Joey, what do we have?
 DJ,
 We have a step… After Miraculous, so do we have, DJ?

Dj  S. Pedronan: Libis?
 Oh, yeah, right, Chanel, where is… it precedes what date?

Shannel Cortez: Viernes?
 Oh, wow, fine. And bareness precedes what day, Michelle?

Michelle Evans: Friday?
 Michelle after Viernes.

Michelle Evans: Is that a little?
 Yep, that's right. And finally… The first day of the week, that would be Arnold.

Arnold Cruz: Lingo.
 Okay, paraming salamat. So, please watch the spelling.
 I, I think… Lunes, Martes…
 Sabado would be almost the same as how you do it in Spanish, but miercules would have a slight change in spelling. Biernes also has a slight change in spelling, and the same thing is true with Jueves.
 Now, I would like you to look at the caption. Our caption is, mga araw ng lingo.
 Look at the translation.
 What is auto in English?
 Elijah?
 You look at the translation of the caption and art, what looks like the translation of manga'ara in English.

Elijah O. Guanzon: per day.
 Yes, right, days, okay? So, Arau would be day, day would be around.
 But there's another concept in Filipino which is named by the word Arau.
 ARO.
 And that is the thing.
 That brightens up every single day.
 Without it, we would all feel cold, and we'd all be in, you know, in a tunnel, or in a cave.
 And that would be… The thing that lights up everyone's day?

Leticia Conway: The sun.
 Yep, it's the sun. So, Arau is sun.
 Arau is day. Remember earlier we said Buwan is month, buwan is moon.
 Let's look at the third one. I mean, yeah, the third thing in here.
 I'm referring to lingo with the capital letter L.
 Okay, you look at our calendar, look at this calendar that I just… that we just came from. Lingo is with a capital letter N, and the translation is Sunday.
 Here, however, I label this as mga araw ng lingo days of the week, simply because it's the caption. But if I were to write this, this word,
 as a normal part of a phrase or sentence, I would write it with a small letter L. So I am… I'm not going to write that with a small letter L or lowercase L, lingbo, and that would mean
 weak.
 Okay?
 So,
 Arau means sun, araw means day, one means moon, one means man. Any questions, mga na?
 Questions?
 Okay, you know, something to enrich our vocabulary with.
 Now, let's do a little review… oh, no, a little introduction, rather, to some time markers, and why are we doing this? Because the nouns that we just met are used in our time markers. So, I'd like you to look at all my red, or orange-red entries.
 What… what pins?
 would you associate with these expressions? Present, past, or future? Oliver?

Oliver O: Sorry, can you say that again? What, what tense you would associate with…
 Yes.

Oliver O: Every month, every day.

Oliver O: For the… for the first…
 All those in red.

Oliver O: Oh, present.
 Okay, that's right, present. I attempted to do some color coding. I hope the contrasts work from your end. Okay, present tense, that's right. And so, if we look at the English translation.
 From the second to the last entry in red, what is the recurring partial, or what is the word that keeps coming up?
 Jaden.

Jaeden B: Hi, Paul, every!
 Yes, very good. Every. Now, look at the Filipino translation.
 We say every day, and we reduplicate the noun, araw. So we say araw, ao. We say every month, we reduplicate one, one, one, ta'on, ta'on, lingo, lingo…
 Okay, for some of the expressions, however, we don't do a reduplication of the noun, but we use an indicator of frequency, and that would be, for example, Michelle, would you kindly read the Filipino translation for every morning?

Michelle Evans: Doing Umaga.
 Magaming salamatanak, and what about DJ, the Filipino translation for every Sunday?

Dj  S. Pedronan: Doing lingo.
 And every December, DJ?

Dj  S. Pedronan: during December.
 Alright, so what is the word that we use to mark the frequency of the action?

Dj  S. Pedronan: wing.
 To wing, correct. So, if you see to wing in a phrase or in a sentence.
 That means that you're looking at
 We are looking at a time… an action, rather, that occurs frequently.
 Regularly, okay, on a habitual basis. Tu-wing, umaga, tuing lingo, tuing the chamber. Tu-wing pasco, tu-wing tag araw, tu-wing tag sibor. Or, if there is a reduplication of the noun, then you know that
 The action being referred to by the verb is something that's happening on a habitual basis, or happening pre-presently.
 Okay? Let's look at the purple entries.
 Look at the purple entries and let me know, Esper, what tense
 Is associated, or maybe associated, with these expressions.

Esperanza Corpus: Past tense?
 past tense, okay, that's right. Now, let's read the markers together. Everybody please unmute.
 And everybody, please say, Kahapon.

Shannel Cortez: bone?
 Kagabi.

Katelyn Kingsbury: Cargo B.
 Noong isang araw.

Bryan Isidro: No, no, no.

samantha garcia: Don't auto.
 Kamakalawa.

Katelyn Kingsbury: pillow off.

Elijah O. Guanzon: Mom.
 Canina.
 Kanina. Okay, yeah, I'm sorry, this one came in, you know, you're a freak. Okay, that's… except tomorrow, huh? So, kamakalawa, kanina, kagabi kahapon. What is the recurring partial, in the words that I just read?

Anna Cerrone: Probably.

Jessica: Huh?

Katelyn Kingsbury: Kuh?
 Correct! That's right. It's very obvious, right? So when you see an indicator of time, and you see a Ka in there, then immediate assumption would be, oh, this thing refers to the past.
 Okay? So kagabi kahapon kamakalawa kanina. And there's another marker in here, which is not a ka, but we say noong isang araw.
 I can also say noong lingo, noong Pasco, noong tagara. Noong is also an indicator of Pasco.
 And let's look at the rest of the table.
 We have the green entries, and, Adriana, what do you suspect would the green entries be referring to?
 What, tense, or time?

Adriana Gomez: Future?
 Future, okay, futuro, or future, that's right. So you have next week, the day before… actually, tomorrow should be part of this. I'm sorry for the…
 For the glitch.
 And on Thursday. So, let's look at all of them again. Please read aloud for us, Sean, beginning with Bucas, please.
 Sean?
 Okay.
 So, Chris… oh, Christine can agree that loud, she's at work. Anna?
 Please read aloud, beginning with Bukhas.

Anna Cerrone: For all of them, or just Bucas?
 All of that.
 Okay, first three, first three.
 Okay, it's long. Because…

Anna Cerrone: Sir, a sang lingo?

Anna Cerrone:
 Okay?

Anna Cerrone: Somewhat salallahuwa?
 All right, very good. Jayden, the last two, please.

Jaeden B: Hi, Bolt.
 Yes.

Jaeden B: So, whoever is…
 And…

Jaeden B: Mama, yeah.
 All right, maraming salamat.

Jaeden B: Salamat po…
 Walanganuman, what do you notice among… this.
 What is the recurring partial among these, Lord?

samantha garcia: duh?
 Lordy?

Lordisel Reyes: Stop.
 Yes, that's right. So you say sa, sa darating, sa makalawa, sa. So when you hear the expression sa, you know that you're being referred to an action or a time in the future.
 Okay, now SA would be different. This one is simply SA.
 Okay?
 So, now I would like you to look at this.
 Will you read that aloud, Victor?
 Victor, would you read this aloud, please?
 Oh, Victorian deer… George?
 Dark bees?
 Okay, MJ.

MJ Seapno: Yes, Bob.
 Yes.
 What is it?

MJ Seapno: Can we say it again, ma'am?
 A.
 Please read aloud what I have encircled or marked.

MJ Seapno: Salisangling go, slang.
 No, no, no.
 This one.

MJ Seapno: some…
 this one.

MJ Seapno: Sa makala… sa makalawa?
 Okay, samakalawa. One more time.

MJ Seapno: Samakalawat.
 And please read the English translation.

MJ Seapno: The day after tomorrow.
 Maraming salamat. Okay, DJ, please read aloud what I just marked.

Dj  S. Pedronan: Gamagalawa.
 And please read aloud the English translation.

Dj  S. Pedronan: The day before yesterday.
 Okay, fine.
 These two words can bring about some confusion.
 But you will avoid being confused if you consider the first syllable of each word.
 So, Ka marks past action.
 But sa marks a future action. Kamakalawa?
 Samakalawa future.
 Any questions about that?
 I hope that helps.

Oliver O: Okay, so… What does Makalawa by itself mean?
 Okay… Maraming salamat, Oliver, sa tanumwa nak,
 Makalawa comes from Dalawa, which means…
 Okay, so Dalawa… means…
 So you count… You count two backwards.
 the day before yesterday. So you don't count one backward.
 It's not yesterday, but you count one more day backward.
 And that would be the day before yesterday.
 Okay? Here, the same thing, you don't count one forward.
 Because that would be tomorrow, but you count two days,
 The second day from today. So it's basically coming from the word dalawa.
 Okay, I hope that answers your question, Oliver.
 Any other questions?
 Any more questions? All right, so if you have no questions, we are ready to do some little practice, some question and answer, and now we are using the word, or the question word, ano, to be able to answer… to be able to ask questions. Ano means what?
 So, anong araw ngayon?
 Anong araw ngayon, Cesar?
 Would you be able to? Okay, so DJ is ready to answer. DJ…

Dj  S. Pedronan: What day is it today?
 Oh, yeah? Okay, so answer that.

Dj  S. Pedronan: It is… Maritas, September… September… living… Anim?
 All right, yeah, you gave more than what you were asked for. Very good, DJ. So, let's just take your first response. So, Martes, and then what do you add to be able to complete your response?
 You listened to my question, anong araw ngayon?
 So you say Martez, and you add… Ad nayon.
 Okay, so how did we answer the question?
 we took… I mean, we identified the day of the week.
 And then we just took a part of the question.
 added it to our response. So we took ngayon.
 We added it to our response, and we were able to respond to a known allow. What is the response to a known allow? It's Martez.
 Okay? So this is the shortest way to answer the question, anong araw ngayon.
 Fair, would you have any other answer for… I mean, to this question?

Fir Selag: Yes.
 Any other way to answer the question? Okay.

Fir Selag: Ang, ang, ang araw ngayon ay Marques.
 Okay, let's write that down.
 Hmm?
 Arau nga yun ahi martes.
 Okay, so that's the sentence using the linker I. The first response does not use the linker I. What is the pattern? It is predicate and subject. In the second response, we have the subject ang arrow, and then
 The time marker ngayon, the linker eye, and then the response to the question, a non arrow, which is Martez.
 Okay, any other way to answer the question? Can you think of any other way?
 Chanel?

Shannel Cortez: No, sorry.
 Okay, that's fine, that's fine. Leti, can you think of any other way?
 To answer the question?
 We're just trying to explore all possibilities.

Leticia Conway: I'm Martez.
 I'm sorry?
 Please say it again, Leti.

Leticia Conway: Oh.

Leticia Conway: ganun din ang sagot po ang araw ngayon ay Martez.
 Okay, maraming salon.

Leticia Conway: Ion hay Martez.
 Alright, that's it!
 Ningayon?
 Yes. Okay. So,
 So, name the day.
 the time, the time marker, martes ngayon. Or you can have a subject plus eye plus predicate pattern ang araw ngayon eye martes. Or you can have…
 you know, something to substitute for the subject, which is ngayon, and then you add ay martes. Okay, martes would actually be the response to the question on anong Arab.
 Okay.
 Now, let's go to the next question.
 Shall we do a Q&A here?
 Oliver, please read question number

Oliver O: Anong araw kahapang?
 And Oliver, please call somebody to answer you.

Oliver O: Sorry.

Oliver O: Christine?

Oliver O: Mark? Christine is at work, so she can't. Oh, got it. Okay.

Oliver O: Anna?

Oliver O: All right, better.

Anna Cerrone: What was the question? So, like, am I answering number

Anna Cerrone: the response?
 You can pattern your response.
 Your responses… from these agents.

Anna Cerrone: I don't know what the words are.
 Oh, okay. Kahapon is something that's up there in our…

Anna Cerrone: Awesome.
 Born, God.

Anna Cerrone: Oh.

 So… Alright, would you call somebody else, Oliver?

Oliver O: Fur?

Oliver O: First luck?

Fir Selag: Okay, anong araw kahabi?

Fir Selag: Tahapon ay lunes.

Bryan Isidro: Anong araw samakalawa.

Bryan Isidro: Chanel.

Shannel Cortez: What's some of the… oh… Miracle-e… Aye, some mahalahan.
 Is that… is that it?

Shannel Cortez: Pamba Kalawa?
 Okay.
 So, ngayon, I'm Martez, because I'm miraculous na, diba, or what about samakalawa?
 I think there's some help in the chat.
 Okay.
 So, think about it, class, and please provide a lifeline. Today is Martez.
 Tomorrow is?
 Or Daisy tomorrow?

samantha garcia: Yes.
 And what day will be sa makalawa?

samantha garcia: We've been.
 Okay. So, Chanel, reframe your answer and a…

Shannel Cortez: Pueba Samopala?
 Yes, Thema? Okay, Chanel, call somebody to respond to the question in a different way, another, in another, I mean, with another sentence.

Shannel Cortez: Arnold?
 I'm sure.

Arnold Cruz: You say, Samakalawa ai Huebes?
 Yes, very good! Okay, now Anak, ask the question.

Arnold Cruz: The next one, number
 Yep.

Arnold Cruz: Anong Arau Kamakawa.
 And… Get somebody to answer you!

Arnold Cruz: Leticia?

Leticia Conway: Ang araw kamak langua ay… Lingo.
 Okay, Leti, get somebody to answer the question in a different way.

Leticia Conway: Aspirin?
 As per…

Esperanza Corpus: Semakalawa ay lingo.
 Okay… oh!
 Kamakalawa na tayo, no? Kamakalawa. Yes, that's right. Very good. All I ja, please read question number

Elijah O. Guanzon: Anong araw bukas?
 And call somebody to answer you, Elijah.

Elijah O. Guanzon: See you soon?

Caesar Williams: I'm sorry?

Caesar Williams: Bucas. What is… what does Bucas mean? Can I have some help answering this, please?
 Oh, there! Look at the… look at our… our Canvas page. Go to the purple entry.
 Can you see the purple entry?

Jessica: Wednesday.
 Oh, there. That's the meaning of Bukhasana.
 Okay, so today is Marte, tomorrow is… There they are.

samantha garcia: Excellent, man.
 Blur?
 Alright.

Caesar Williams: Excuse me?
 Yeah, I'm showing you the screen, Anand, where you can.

Caesar Williams: Yeah, I just… I just… I disconnected, and now I'm back in, kinda just skipped for me.
 Okay…

Caesar Williams: So, are you ready to answer now?
 Anong other bukas, that was the question.

Caesar Williams: Yeah.

Caesar Williams: I'm still not sure how to answer it, to be honest. I was trying to figure it out before I lagged out, and…
 Oh, okay, I'll pass for you right now. So, Michelle, would you answer the question?

Michelle Evans: Or… number
 Yes?

Michelle Evans: Ang Arabucas… Mircles.
 I…

Michelle Evans: Bruce.
 Okay, yes, so the pattern that you used is this. But you used bucas, and then you used I. Ai miercoles. Attama magaling.
 Okay, so, let's just try one more of practice. We are actually, you know, sort of raising against time again.

Caesar Williams: And I would like you to look at letter B.
 B.
 Anong unang araw ng lingo? Then number
 Three, webis ngayon, anong araw kahapon.
 Okay, so I'm going to put you in breakout rooms.
 And please answer as many of the questions as you can.
 alternating with each other in

Leticia Conway: What page is that in the book?
 Excuse me, Leti, as soon as you get to the breakout room.
 Assign yourself a role, Student
 With a Q&A. This is on this Canva… oh!
 Sorry, this is this Canvas page.
 I… accidentally clicked something, which made me lose that page. Okay, so it's actually not in the book, it's on our
 materials, so… but I'm going to drop the link.
 So that you'll be able to access it even when you are in the break or two.

Leticia Conway: Oh, okay.
 Okay? So, here it is.
 Here is… Yep.
 Everyone… You have it. The…
 Okay, what is our purpose? Our purpose is to be able to, number one, use the new nouns that we just studied
 Incomplete sentences, and number two, be able to respond to an uno question in a complete sentence. And we can use either the subject plus predicate pattern, or the predicate plus subject pattern.
 Okay, so what are we going to do in the breakout room? M-day.

MJ Seapno: Hello, Bob.
 Yeah, what are we going to do in the breakout room, Anna?

MJ Seapno: We're gonna practice the… B…

MJ Seapno: the questions from the… from the, Section B.
 Okay, Section B. And how much time will you have, Gavin, in the breakout room?

Gavin Meza: I think you said

 are opening. Now, I'm going to recreate
 Let me see…
 Recreate, recreate.
 Okay?
 All the rooms are open now. Please get in as soon as you can, and please start your Q&A.
 Pierre, your room is number

 If you're not able to join, Christine, let me know so I can put Jessica somewhere else on that.
 Are you able to join, Christine?
 Hello, everyone. Please… oh, Cesar is also out. Hello, everyone. Your
 Oh, so Christine is not able to join. Let me just put… Where should she be?
 Okay.
 Jessica, I'll put you in room number
 Paraming salamat at nakabalik na tayo, may mga tanung ba kayo, tungkul sa ating ginawa sa breakout room.
 What was one question which… Seemed to have brought to you some wrinkles.

Leticia Conway: Esper… Esperanza get confused of makalawa and Samakalawa.
 Okay, so SA is future, Ka is the past.

Leticia Conway: Yeah.
 Yes, we are going into the much-needed break right now, don't worry, Kate.
 I just wanted to make sure that everybody felt comfortable after coming out of the breakout room. So, do you have any questions?
 Any questions? Okay, fair. Yes, we'll accommodate.

Fir Selag: Do we have, like, prelim exam, midterm, finals, or just all online quiz?
 Okay, you don't have a midterm exam, but you will have a power final test.
 So, several quizzes, low-state quizzes, and then you have just one big test in this class, and that's the final.

Fir Selag: How many… how many questions in the bin?
 Okay, we'll talk about that later.

Fir Selag: Okay, thank you. So not to scare people. Scare away people.
 Okay, so kung wala kayong mga tanong, break na tayo, it's

Leticia Conway: Thank you!
 a new man, so let me just go to…
 Hello, everyone. Masayang pagbabalik.
 I'm very happy that you're all here, still here.
 And so we are now ready to proceed to the rest of our lessons.
 Last week, the…
 the page on ang mga pambansang sa gisag ng Pilipinas was already open, and I am very happy that most everyone responded to the question on
 mgawat ng Pilipinas. I mean, to the reading comprehension activity on
 Angwatawat ng Pilipinas. We're going back to that page today, page
 In fact, we have already seen and oriented ourselves to two of the national symbols through the objectives page. What are these?
 What are these national symbols?
 Oops!
 I know you know them!
 Any volunteer?

Jessica: That's fair.
 Jessica?

Jessica: The flax.
 Yes?

Adriana Gomez: What the heck?
 What is flagging Filipino again, Jessica?

Jessica: Guataga?
 Yes, Watawat, Kate? Maraming salamat sa sagot. So, ang matawat ng Filipinos. And there's one more national symbol.
 That thing that we've… we have on our objectives page for this week. What is that?
 Adriana, do you remember?

Adriana Gomez: I just remember Watawat…
 Okay.

Adriana Gomez: the, Pledge of Allegiance for the Filipinos?

Adriana Gomez: The National Anthem?
 And the national anthem, that's right, maraming salamat, lordy.
 And pambansang awit ng Pilipinas. Remember, we sang that in week
 Okay? Sorry, so we're going back to page
 what is our objective? Our objective is to be able to orient ourselves to
 the national symbols of the Philippines, and their purpose is to be able to ask and answer no and see no questions. Okay? So…
 So here we are. Share, share… Cher, okay.
 So, the question word, ano.
 means what, and the question word sino means who. So, if we ask the question ano, we are asking for a common noun.
 Ano ango ang araw ngayon? Ano ang Arab bukas? Ano ang pangalan mo? What's your name?
 If we are asking for multiple answers, then we reduplicate ano, ano, ano, ano, ano ang mga kulay ng waatawat ng Pilipinas.
 The same thing would be true with Sino. Sino, which pertains to A person, a proper noun.
 When reduplicated, would be asking for multiple answers. Sino-sino ang mga kaibigan mo. Okay? So, ano and sino.
 Let's, check out page
 However, I'm opening page
 from my end. So,
 Okay.
 So let's go down the page… And let's look at…
 The box which carries mga pambansang sa gisag ng Pilipinas.
 the other national symbols, because we already had one symbol in there. So…
 On the left column, you will find The name, the symbol.
 and on the right column, you will find what it is, a description of the symbol. So please look at the right column in each box. What is the word that keeps coming up?
 In each of these words.

Dj  S. Pedronan: a month's on.
 Okay, that's right. Pam Bansang.
 And the word pambansang comes from the word pambansa, Bum Banza.
 Which means national. Well, let's go to the bait-bearer's point. So, the word pampansang comes from the word bansa.
 Which means country or town.
 Okay, when we want to form an adjective.
 We want to form an adjective, we use the word PAMBANSANG.
 And that would mean… national.
 Okay?
 We add the NG, the ligature NG, Tubanza, with pam, pam bansa.
 to be able to convert this whole thing into an adjective that connects to the noun coming right before it. So, if you look at all of these entries here, you will see pamansang Bayani.
 Pambansang, wika, and so on, up to Pam Bansang. Oh, they should be Pam Bansang with an N in there. Pambansangista.
 What about… Tito Ofel, what about if I just say pambansa bul a klak? Pambansa dahwan? Will I be correct? No, you won't be correct, but you will be understood.
 The NG there is a mark of a modifier of the word coming after it.
 So, in this case, in the case of all of these entries, the NG is a mark of the presence of an adjectival phrase. Pambansa, an adjective, modifying Bula cla, a noun, and the NG is required to connect the adjective to the noun.
 Okay, any questions?
 All right, so we're just familiarizing ourselves right now with the national symbols, and so I would like you to go over this list.
 As best as you can. In fact, you were supposed to have gone over it before you came to class.
 Okay, so let's just read what we have.
 on the left part of its column. Everybody say Jose.

Leticia Conway: Serizan.

Shannel Cortez: Jose or is that?

Katelyn Kingsbury: Say every song.
 Filipino.

Jessica: Yeah, Filipino.

Elijah O. Guanzon: Oh, no.
 Lupang Hinirang.

Adriana Gomez: Blue fun.

Leticia Conway: I mean, ever.

Joshua Nelson: around.
 Barong.

Shannel Cortez: But.

Leticia Conway: Wrong.

Anna Cerrone: Varosaya.

Adriana Gomez: Baron.

Bryan Isidro: I don't know.

Jessica: So, yeah.

Katelyn Kingsbury: notes.
 Aguila.

Katelyn Kingsbury: Oh, yeah.

Elijah O. Guanzon: Hilah.
 Calabau.

Jessica: No.
 Bahaikubo.

Shannel Cortez: Bye-bye!
 Yes, Kate, would you kindly read the next one?

Katelyn Kingsbury: Sampagita?
 Yeah, next one. Kate is still yours.

Katelyn Kingsbury: And, how?
 Yes, Jessica, the next two?

Jessica: Naro?

Leticia Conway: And…

Jessica: manga.
 Okay, manga, there's a and a g. And Gavin, the last two?

Gavin Meza: Lee Son.
 lit.
 Song. And the last one…

Gavin Meza: Bangles.
 Bangoose.

Gavin Meza: fungus.
 Okay, so…
 NG here is pronounced as G, but the NG in manga is also pronounced as G, but because there's a G after it, then you seem to be doubling the sound. So, manga. Ba moose.
 Okay, so these are the national symbols, and you will see… What…
 what each one stands for, so Anahau is Pambansang Dahon. Dahon is in your Quizlet, remember that, mga anak. Kahoe is also in the Quizlet, awit is in the Quizlet, Iban is in the Quizlet, all of these are in the vocabulary for Araling
 So, please don't forget to go over your vocabulary list. Now, what is our objective for this particular part of the lesson? We ask an a no question, and we answer it using the content.
 the content here.
 Okay? Example.
 So this is going to be a lesson on structure and vocabulary. Example, ano ang pampansang ibon ng Pilipinas. Where do we get the answer to that?
 Bombansang Yibon is right here, and Aguila is right here. And then I go back to the question. What? How do I answer this question?
 One is Pampan Sang Iban? National…
 Bird, okay? Nang Pilipinas means of the Philippines. And ano? What does ano mean again, Joshua?

Oliver O: what…
 What? Okay, that's right. So, there was another Joshua, who answered. So, ano ang pamansang iba ng Pilipinas, what is the national bird of the Philippines? And one way to answer the question is this.
 Arnold, please read it aloud.

Arnold Cruz: Agila ang pamban sang ibun ang Pilpinas.
 Nang, Filipinas.
 Yes, okay, so let's not… maraming salamat anak, let's not forget that the word NG… is pronounced
 That's the pronunciation of anti.
 is the pronunciation, okay? So,
 That's the pattern. You may answer in a different, or using a different structure, but the simplest pattern would be this. So again, ano ang pampansang ibun ng Pilipinas, immediately give the answer to ano, and that would be Agila, and then repeat the rest of the question.
 Agila ang pampansang ibon ng Pilipinas.
 Okay? So we first focus on the anom.
 Brian?
 Ano ang pampansang wika ng Pilipinas?

Bryan Isidro: Filipino?
 Okay, answer in a complete sentence enough!
 You follow this pattern, follow the pattern to answer my question, Brian.

Bryan Isidro: Agila ang pangmansang wika?

Bryan Isidro: ng Filipino.
 Okay, you follow the pattern, but don't copy the answer.
 Okay? Aguila is Ivan.
 Ivan… is Aguilar.

Bryan Isidro: Ebon…
 is Aguira, okay?

Bryan Isidro: Filipino ang bambansang ibon ng Filipinas.
 Okay, very close, but we are not talking about Ebon, right? We are talking about WICA, so look at this.

Bryan Isidro: Oh…
 Mika, yeah.

Bryan Isidro: Filipino ang Pam and San Huica ng Filipinas.
 Yes, very good! Okay, good job, Brian!
 Now, I would like… I would like you to ask a question, Brian, on any of these.
 Any of these, symbols.
 Begin your question with a no.
 Something similar to… this.

Bryan Isidro: I know, ang… Pam Bansang kasuutan.

Bryan Isidro: Barong ng Pilpinas. No, don't give the answer.
 Don't give you the answer.

Bryan Isidro: Yay.
 Again, one more time!

Bryan Isidro: Ano ang pamansang kasuuta ng Pilipinas?
 Yes, perfect! And call somebody to answer you.

Bryan Isidro: Elijah.
 Good.

Elijah O. Guanzon: Panzao Kasubutan ng Piliginas.
 Okay, Elijah, maraming salamat. A barong is for males.
 And please include this one also, Barod Saya. Barodzaya is for ladies. So barong is for gen… for men, barotsaya is for ladies.
 So… Elijah, your response should be… barong.

Elijah O. Guanzon: at barotsaya ang pambansang kasuhuta ng Pilipinas.
 Angling, okay. Please ask a question, Elijah.

Elijah O. Guanzon: Ano ang pansang bayani ng pinigilas?
 Okay, let's not include Bayani yet, because we need another question word for him.
 That's just… Nevermind result. Yet.
 So, ask another question, I mean, ask a question on another content.

Elijah O. Guanzon: Ano, ang pampan sa brutas ng Filipinas?
 Yes!
 Call out.

Elijah O. Guanzon: Her?
 Okay, fair, you're called…

Fir Selag: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Fir Selag: Manga ang… Pambansang prutas ng Pilipinas.
 You ask your question.

Fir Selag: Oh, you want me to ask a question? Okay.

Fir Selag: unknown.

Fir Selag: Ang pambansang bahay ng ilipinas.

Fir Selag: Esperanza.

Esperanza Corpus: Ang pang bansang bahay ng Filipinas ay bahay Kubo.

Fir Selag: Learning good.
 Keep going.

Esperanza Corpus: Ano ang pampansang balaclak ng Filipinas?

Esperanza Corpus: Jessica?

Jessica: Okay.

Jessica: Some baggita, ang, family, Bula lac in Filipinas.
 Hula clock, yes? Ask your question, Jessica.
 and call.

Jessica: Indiana.
 Call Adriana to answer you.

Jessica: Okay.

Jessica: Ano ang pamangsang?

Jessica: Isa en Filipinas.

Jessica: It's miracle.

Jessica: For who?

Jessica: Is Miranda?
 I think it's for Adriana.

Jessica: Oh, Angiana.
 Yeah, no Esmeralda here. She is…

Jessica: Adriana.

Adriana Gomez: What's the ESA?
 Here…

Adriana Gomez: No.

Adriana Gomez: Founders.
 Okay, are you able to see my screen, Adriana?

Adriana Gomez: Yeah, but I don't know what bangles means.
 Oh, ista. It's and is the.

Adriana Gomez: I don't get it. I don't know what bangus or Isa mean.
 Oh, okay, so in our Quizlet, the Quizlet for Arling
 Fish.
 Okay, do you get it now, Adriana?

Adriana Gomez: So she's asking about… One fish?
 Pampansang is the national fish.
 She's asking about the national fish.
 And the answer is right here.

Adriana Gomez: Bangus?
 And then… You… you complete your sentence, Regular and… No, no.
 No, it's not Agila, your answer is Bangoose, not Agila. Aguila is a bird, Iban.
 So, your answer is, is the.
 Bang moose.

Adriana Gomez: So, is the… Nan. Bambasan.
 Oh my goodness.

Adriana Gomez: Filipinas?
 Okay, so, alright, class, we were working on this pattern.
 And we already had some responses.
 So, for example, Elijah said… Elijah said, barong at barotsaya ang pampansang kasuutan ng Pilipinas. And then somebody said.
 Sam paguita ang pampansang balaclat ng Pilipinas. And somebody else earlier said, bahay kubo ang pampansang bahay ng Pilipinas. So you have that pattern already.
 So, what do you do to be able to answer the question? You cite the content, or the name of the national symbol, and then you say what it is, and complete your sentence by adding Nang Pilipinas.
 Okay, can you follow that pattern, Adriana? Let's call somebody else, for the whole thing to sink in. Joshua, would you answer the question? The question was, ano ang pampanzang is that non-Pilipinas?

Joshua Nelson: Livinas.
 Yes, I'm going very smooth, okay? Josh, please ask a question.
 And everyone else, please follow the pattern, okay? Yes, Josh?

Joshua Nelson: I've unsung… Cowboy, non-Pilipinas.
 Yes! And get somebody to answer you!

Joshua Nelson: Gavin?
 Okay, Gavin is called.

Gavin Meza: Narar. Ang, ambassad.

Gavin Meza: Kahoe, and Filipinas.
 Yes, very good. Okay, now, Gavin, it's your turn to ask a question, Anna.

Gavin Meza: Ano ang Poisson.

Gavin Meza: what kind?

Gavin Meza: Now, Filipinos.
 Okay, yes, good question, and maybe you can call on Kate.

Gavin Meza: Kate.

Katelyn Kingsbury: Okay, Lichon… Ang Pam Banan Sang.

Katelyn Kingsbury: Pagain ang Pilipinas?
 Yes, Kate, your turn to ask a question.

Katelyn Kingsbury: Okay, ano ang pampan sang?

Katelyn Kingsbury: Protas ang Pilipinas.
 Non-Pilipinas, yes, and call somebody!

Katelyn Kingsbury: Anna?
 I'm sorry, what was it?

Katelyn Kingsbury: Anna?
 Okay,

Anna Cerrone: blabbis.
 Okay, yes, so it's manga.

Anna Cerrone: manga.
 Yes. Okay, Anna, ask your question.

Anna Cerrone: Anoang… Pam Bunsung… Hay up in Pilipinas?
 High up, yeah, okay.

Anna Cerrone: Okay, high up.
 And maybe you can call on Cesar.

Anna Cerrone: Okay, Caesar?

Caesar Williams: So that would be… Kalaba ang Pamban sang.

Caesar Williams: High up in Pittipinis.
 Okay, very good. Now, Cesar, ask your question.

Caesar Williams: Ano ang pan bansang.

Caesar Williams: Awwet, Filipinas.
 Okay…
 And maybe you can call on DJ or MJ.

Caesar Williams: Mj?
 MJ, are you here?

MJ Seapno: Sorry, I'm lagging. I know I've got a long question, but…
 Please repeat your question, Cesar.

Caesar Williams: Ano ang pampan sang awit ng Pilipinas?

MJ Seapno: Ang pembansang awit ng Pilipina sail lupang hinirang.
 Okay.
 MJ, ask your question.

MJ Seapno: Ano ang pampansang bayani ng Filipinas?
 No, no, this one. This one, the one that I just marked.

MJ Seapno: Ano ang pombansang wika ng Pilipinas?
 Okay.
 Call somebody of your choice.

MJ Seapno: DJ?

Dj  S. Pedronan: Filipino ang Pampan Song… Pamansong We Cat, not Filipinos.
 Okay, maraming salonaman sa inyong lahat. So, nakuha ninyo ang pattern, ha, you're able to get the word order.
 So, what did we do? We asked a question beginning with ANO, or introduced by ANO, and we answered with one of these symbols, and we used the simplest pattern. So, we just placed the immediate answer.
 right at the beginning of the sentence, then we repeated the rest of the question. That's the simplest way to answer the question. You can answer it in a different way, that you can have the sub… the…
 like, part of the latter part of the question at the beginning, like.
 Ang pambansang wika ng Pilipinas ay, and then you give the content.
 But that would be the longer way. This one is the shorter way. Now let's go to sino. Sino would refer to persons, people, proper nouns. So there's only one sino question that we can ask here, and that would be about Jose Rizal.
 So, Chanel, would you ask a see-no question based on this?

Shannel Cortez: Tino ang pambadsang bayani ng Pilipinas.
 And ask somebody to answer you.

Shannel Cortez: Lourdessell?
 No, not Lordysell.
 Somebody else.

Shannel Cortez: Michelle?
 Okay, let me share.

Michelle Evans: Pombansong, Bayani, and Filipinas.
 One more time, Michelle, I will write your answer on the board, and I…

Michelle Evans: Jose Risal, si bambang sang bayani ng Pilipinas.
 Okay, bambansang, bayani ng, pili-pie.
 NAS.
 So, this is how we answered an… a see-no question. So, the question was, see-no, ang pampansang bayani ng Pilatinas. Who is the national hero of the Philippines?
 The response is, you need the noun marker C, because you are referring to a proper noun, si Joseal, and then repeat the rest of the question.
 Ang pambansang bayani ng Pilipinas. So, where do we put C? We put it right before the proper noun.
 And then, ang pambansang bayani, we need the ang in there, because it's modifying bayani.
 of the Philippines ng Pilipinas, okay?
 Is there any other see-no question that you can ask the… with the Joseal as the answer?
 I mean, is there any other single question you can ask about Pocerizal?
 Annie?
 Any questions?

Michelle Evans: You can ask, you know, C, Jose Rizal.
 Yes, very good, Michelle! Si no si, Jose Rizal, okay? And the response would be similar to that.
 Asi no sijo serizal!
 Let me see.
 Leti?

Leticia Conway: Si, Jose Rizal ay ang pampansang hero, or siya… Ang pambansang.

Leticia Conway: Bayani ng Pilipinas.
 Okay, Susari sal ang pamansangbayani nung Pilipinas, or Sioceri Sal ay ang pamansang bayani ng Pilipinas. Ta.
 Any questions?
 Now, you need this, all of these content to be able to work on the learning quiz that's waiting for you. So there's actually a learning quiz part B,
 And it's going to open in a few minutes, but before we… I mean, we will open that when we are ready for it. So, do you have any questions right now?
 Any questions?
 Okay, may tanong ba… Okay.
 So, what did we just do?
 We, in the last hour, one and a half hours, we reviewed the use of, the noun markers ang mga cisina, and then we
 We practiced using the question word nasa'an.
 and answering it using a NASA phrase, and using the noun markers ang mga sina in our responses, and in our questions. Then, we went
 over the names of the days of the week, months of the year, and some time markers, because these would also fall under nouns. Then we also had some question and answer in these. And then finally, we had
 The national symbols, And we practiced using…
 I mean, we practice constructing sentences with the national symbol as content, or as the subject, and with ano and sino as our question words.
 Okay?
 Actually, for this week, I have lined up
 the assignment on pagpapakilala, but… because we don't have time to do that in Zoom, because I really would like to do that with all of us gathered in Zoom. I'm going to postpone that for next week, so later on, I'm going to modify our objectives for this week.
 And, I'm going to bump down introduction to next week, okay? Now, right now, we are moving to the un pronouns. We need the knowledge on the un pronouns to be able to do meaningful introductions.
 Okay, so, break, break for a little while, let's do some relaxing. I know that was quite a content that we went over, so let me stop sharing.
 And let me see if I can pull something up in here.
 Hmm… let me see…
 Oh.
 Go through…
 Okay, are you familiar with rag, paper, scissors?

MJ Seapno: Are you familiar…
 Yeah, okay. So, if it's rug, paper, scissors, we can do it the Filipino way, or the Pinoy way, so it would be something like this.
 So, you don't hear anything?
 Signal angulation.
 Holy…

Leticia Conway: And not hear it.
 Sorry. I'm sorry about that.
 Hmm, there.
 Oh. Sorry about that. So, no volume?
 No sound.

Leticia Conway: Yep.
 Oh, that's so sad. Okay, shall we… shall we try again?
 I, I just reloaded, can we try again?
 Okay, did you hear anything the second time?

Leticia Conway: No.
 No. No.

Fir Selag: Yeah.
 Sorry about that, and yet our monkeys are just so excited to share with you. So it's saying, Jack and boy.
 Okay, that's how the song goes, and the English version, which is very short, is actually down here. Jack and boy, hali, hali Hoi, whoever loses is the monkey. And as that is being done, the two participants would be showing their hands, you know how you do it?
 in a rock-paper, salt, scissors kind of game, and if the paper…
 you know, catches the rock, then the paper wins. If the scissors… the pair of scissors catches the paper, then the scissors will win, and so on. So… I… I'm not sure,
 I'm not sure if you would like to try that right now. So, but you have to show your faces, you have to show your hands. So, would you like to play jack and pot?
 Oh, okay, maybe you will be ready to do that next time, but next time you're going to do or play Jack and Poi during the break, or in transition… as a transition from one lesson to the other.
 This time, let's just leave Jack and Poi on the side. And I would like us to look at, now, the personal pronouns, the unpronouns, which we need to be able to do introductions.
 Okay?
 So here it is on page…
 Yeah. There is actually a PowerPoint presentation before this, And let me just… Show that to you.
 And let me just stop sharing so it will come up on your end.
 There we go.
 Okay.
 So there is a recording, but I would like to open the link.
 So I'm opening the link to the PowerPoint, and this is what comes up on your end.
 This is a general introduction to… the ANG pronouns.
 Okay. In English, you call them personal pronouns.
 And these are your own pronouns.
 On the left column, you have the singular pronouns ako, which means I, ikao or ka, which is equivalent to you, and xia, which is equivalent to he, she, or it, the personalized it.
 So, I would always ask people to say… say the words as they gest… you know, they do a gesture. So.
 Y cow or ca, sia is the other person.
 And the plural form would be CAMI.
 Come meet, you are not included.
 Tallo. You are included.
 Kayo is only you, plural, not including me, and Sila, they.
 Okay, so these are the

Anna Cerrone: Everybody, please.
 Unmute.

Fir Selag: Okay, everybody say ako, as you point to yourself. Ako. Ako. Akko. Icao.

Adriana Gomez: So…

Bryan Isidro: Wow.
 Bah.

Bryan Isidro: Yeah.

Michelle Evans: John.

Katelyn Kingsbury: Yeah.

Leticia Conway: Yeah.
 So it's not… it's not me, it's not you, it is Sia.
 And then, let's say, Camille.

Adriana Gomez: Amazing.

Fir Selag: For me, man.

Anna Cerrone: Excuse me.
 Ayo!

Adriana Gomez: Talio.
 Ayo.

Adriana Gomez: Are you…

Anna Cerrone: Ayo. Ayo.
 La.

Arnold Cruz: Si la.

Bryan Isidro: that.

Fir Selag: Good luck.
 That's right.
 So, you go back to week
 to one single reference. So, if we are referring to our lolo or to our Lola, we would say, kumusta po kayo lola. Kumusta po kayo lolo. We don't say, kumusta po Lola. That's not very respectful.
 All right, any observations about the personal pronouns, how we use them, and how they translate to English?

Anna Cerrone: I'm sorry.
 Any observations that you… oh, well, any observations about the personal pronouns? What do you notice about them when you look at their English translations?

Adriana Gomez: So, Sila and Kami are not the same, right? Even though Kami means them?
 Very good, yeah.
 Kami is plural, sila is plural, but Sila, that's not including myself. It is just other people. They. Sila is they, okay? While Kami is myself and the people in my company. I'm not even including you.
 Okay.
 Yes, you're right in saying that me and Sila are not the same. Any other observations?
 Or other questions?
 Okay, you will notice… And you should know this.
 that in Filipino, there is only one word to stand for, singular third person.
 singular third-person reference. It's just Xia. You don't have to, genderize. You don't have to think in terms of, is it a he, or a she, or an it? You don't have to go into that trouble. You just use the general, generic term Xia.
 Okay? And notice this one, too. Camille is exclusive, it's just me and my company, you are not included.
 Tayo, however, is inclusive. I am speaking for and talking about myself.
 The people I am with, and you, the people I'm talking to.
 Okay, that's what we mean by inclusive and exclusive. Any questions?
 Anyway.

Jessica: Yes, sweetie.
 Yeah, question. Is that Adriana?

Jessica: Jessica.
 Oh, Jessica. Okay, Jessica.

Jessica: So, how would you use kami in a sentence if it's exclusive and it's plural, but you're not in the group?
 Okay, so… Good question, thank you so much for that. So, here we go.
 We have examples of sentences here using
 I'm sorry, using all of those personal pronouns. So, kami… Comes right here.
 But let's start with the singular,
 Singular pronouns. So, Filipino ako, I am a Filipino. Filipino ka, you are Filipino, or you are a Filipino. Filipino sha, he is Filipino, or she is Filipino.
 Filipino kami, we… we are Filipinos. You are not included. And I'm talking about you. I'm talking about myself and the people in my group. But if I say Filipino tayo.
 I'm talking about myself.
 and people in my group, and you. So we, including you, are Filipinos, Filipino Tayo. So that's how Cami and Tayo
 would be used. Filipino kayo, I'm talking about you, you are Filipinos. And Filipino sila, sila, Filipino sila, they are Filipinos.
 This is the predicate plus subject pattern. Predicate Filipino, subject, subject is the doer of the action.
 Let's move down the page.
 We have a different pattern here. The subject… oh, sorry.
 the predicate plus subject pattern the first time. Predicate is Filipino, ako is a subject. This time, you have the subject plus predicate pattern.
 Ako, ay Pilipino, ikao ay Pilipino. Sia ay Pilipino.
 And then the rest of the sentences would have the same pattern with a different pronoun. Okay, fair, fair?

Fir Selag: Y-es, so… I think, to clarify, if somebody's saying, Camille, The person that…

Fir Selag: I'm talking to is not included.
 Yeah, that's right.

Fir Selag: But I'm included, because Camille.

Fir Selag: I'm EI Filipino, and I'm talking to somebody else who is not Filipino, so I'm included, the exclusive is the person I'm talking to.
 The one who is excluded is my audience. Yeah, that's right.

Fir Selag: Yes, yes, that's what it means.
 That's right. Okay, marang salamat fur. Any other questions?
 Okay, so this is subject plus predicate pattern. You compare. I want you to compare these…
 Watch as my, my page goes up, up.
 bet.
 Okay, watch as I scroll up. Oh, you compare. This is the first group of sentences, predicate plus subject pattern. This is the second group of sentences, subject plus predicate pattern. Do you see any difference in the structure, mga na?
 What is present here, which is absent here?

Leticia Conway: It interchanges.
 What is present here?

Leticia Conway: Aye.
 Okay, that's right. In the predicate plus subject pattern, there is no I. You don't need the I. In… you need the I only for the subject plus predicate pattern.

Leticia Conway: Okay.
 Now, I want you to please study all our materials before coming to class.
 Remember, we don't have a lot of time to explain all of this on a face-to-face basis, so please study the materials before coming to class so we can
 When we come to class, we will just be doing the practice exercises. Oliver, your hand is up and up. Go, go ahead with your question.

Oliver O: Is the I, like, like, the verb to be? Like, ako, I, Filipino, I am Filipino? Is that accurate?
 Yeah, roughly it is that, but it is not the legitimate equivalent, because there can be another word to represent that in different… in another structure, and that would be ANG. So I is just one of them, one of those little words that can represent
 The, you know, close to, rather, that would be close to the linker.
 is our aswear, okay? So for now, we can say it is… it is, in these sentences, the equivalent of…
 is… and R.
 Okay.
 Fur, your hand is still up.
 Have a question?
 Orwellana. Alright, Adriana has a question.

Adriana Gomez: Okay, so Kami would be, like, them, since I would not be included when I use Kami.
 Camille would be myself.
 and the people who I am with.
 I am not including the people I'm talking to.
 So, for example, I'm here, and Bran, Oliver, and Leti are with me. I would… and I'm talking to you, I would say, kami ahi gutom. We are hungry, okay? But I am not talking about your feeling.

Adriana Gomez: Okay.
 Yes. If I say, then I'm talking about Adriana, Ferr, Oliver, Leti.
 I mean, I'm talking about Fair, Oliver, Letty, myself, and you, Adriana, whom I am talking to.
 V tayo eigoton, it is inclusive.
 It includes the person being spoken to.
 Okay, I understand the confusion, the difficulty with cami and tayo. That's actually one thing that makes the personal pronouns in Filipino distinct from other grammars in the entire world.
 English doesn't have that. English just has we, and that's it.
 Okay? But for us, we distinguish between, are you part of the group, or are you not in the group? Are you being… are you included, or are you excluded?
 That's the uniqueness of Filipino personal pronouns.
 Okay, so please read up on all the lessons that are posted on Canvas, and please read on all the pages of the textbook that are referred to. For now, I think we're ready to, let's see, open the quiz, and let me just show that learning quiz to you.
 Soap.
 Here it is.
 Oops.
 Let me stop shooting.
 Okay, so here is your learning quiz. It's the second part of the quiz on nouns and noun markers. You have to train in an audio recording for this quiz.
 But you're welcome to do a video recording if you feel like it.
 So, the directions answer
 You have to choose one see no question, and the others would be a no questions.

 So… How many questions beginning with C, no? C, no, are you going to ask?

Leticia Conway: Hmm.

Arnold Cruz: One.

 Total number of questions.

Leticia Conway: war.

 Simple instructions on how to do the recording. The quiz is available now. It's due by the
 It's… it's due by tomorrow.
 Okay, so… May mga talong ba kayo mga anak.
 Okay, wala kay yung mga tanong. Oops, bakit na wala.

Leticia Conway: So, there is… there is a link.

Leticia Conway: There is a link that we can click so we can record directly to Canvas.

Leticia Conway: Dr. Question?
 Actually, two studio, studio workloads.

Leticia Conway: There we go.
 Should allow you, okay? Thank you. So,
 as I've said earlier, we did not have time to go to the lesson on making introductions, doing introductions, so we are moving that to next week.
 Okay, so the… the lessons that we were able to cover for now are just the lessons on noun and noun markers. Review, the use of nasan in connection to nouns and noun markers.
 Name… months and days… names of the months, and names of the days of the week, and other time markers.
 And… The national symbols…
 in connection to the use of the question words ANO and SINO, and we had a brief introduction to ANG pronouns. Please continue working on the ang pronouns activities. Pages
 Okay, there will also be a quiz on ang pronouns on I mean, in week
 Okay, maraming salamat ulay mga anak sa inyong pagtating sa ating Zoom meeting at sa inyong masigasig na participation. Thank you so much for coming to our Zoom meeting and for your deep engagement in our activities. Please come back next week, and please continue to follow the class online.

**ChatGPT:**

Totally got it. I can work with a transcript this size. You don’t *have* to remove timestamps, but it helps. If you want the cleanest results:

* Strip timestamps and filler (e.g., “uh,” lag notes).
* Keep Filipino text as-is (don’t auto-correct spellings like *buwan/buwan*, *araw/ARAU*—context matters).
* If possible, chunk by topic headers you already covered (“Nasaán Q&A,” “Days/Months,” “Pambansang ____,” “ANG pronouns”).


If you’d like, I can ingest exactly what you pasted and still build from it. Removing timestamps just reduces noise.


# Short Story with Dialog + In-Story Quiz (Filipino 1)


**Setting:** Saturday (*Sabado*) at a campus fair. You (the learner) bump into **Oliver** and **Leti** near a map.
**Oliver:** *Magandang hapon!* Nasaán **ang** info booth?

* *Siya* = he/she
* *Kami* = we (exclusive, not you)
* *Tayo* = we (inclusive, including you)
* *Kayo* = you (plural/polite)
* *Sila* = they


**Leti (points at snacks):** *Gutom kami.* (You not included)
**Oliver (to the group including you):** *Busog tayo!* (You included)
**You (quiz 8):** Rewrite **“Busog tayo!”** to exclude the listener you’re speaking to (keep meaning “We are full,” but exclusive).
**Mia (final lightning):** Translate quickly…
**You (quiz 9):** “Where are the books?” → Use **Nasaán** + **ang mga** + noun “aklat”.

## Optional add-ons you could include next time



* A short **glossary box** for locations used with **nasa** (e.g., *bahay, eskuwelahan, mesa, kalsada, liwasan, banqueta*).
* A **mini pattern card** in the prompt: * **Nasaán + (si/sina/ang/ang mga) NOUN?** → **Nasa + PLACE + (si/sina/ang/ang mga) NOUN.** * **Ano + ang + pambansang X + ng Pilipinas?** → **[Answer] ang pambansang X ng Pilipinas.** * **Sino + ang … ?** → **Si [Name] ang …**
* Request the story to **alternate** predicate-subject and subject-predicate (with **ay**) so you get exposure to both.
* Ask for **mix of question types** (MCQ, fill-in, translate, identify marker).
* Specify **word bank** you want reinforced (days, months, time markers *kahapon/kagabi/kanina/samakalawa/kamakalawa*, noun markers *si/sina/ang/ang mga*, ANG-pronouns).


If you want, I can turn this exact story into **Anki Cloze notes** later.
