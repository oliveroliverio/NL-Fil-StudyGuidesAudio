These aren't required unless you want the full system, but many teachers include them:

## **Oblique Pronouns (for objects of the verb, after prepositions like *sa*)**

## **Possessive Pronouns (Enclitic / Attached form)**

Used after nouns, e.g., *bahay ko*, *kaibigan niya*, *kapitbahay namin*

| **Person** | **Singular** | **Plural** |
