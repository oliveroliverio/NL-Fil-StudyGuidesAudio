**ChatGPT:**

Great work — your sample sentences are mostly correct, but let’s go through them carefully, then I’ll explain the **Filipino principles for pronoun choice (ako vs ko, ikaw vs ka, etc.)** and the **subject–predicate word order rules** you should review.


## ✅ Sentence-by-sentence check



1. **Si Martha ako.** ✔ Correct. ("I am Martha.") Uses **ako** as subject.
2. **Martha ang pangalan ko.** ✔ Correct. ("Martha is my name.") Uses **ko** because *pangalan* is the subject, and **ko** shows possession.
3. **Kumusta ka, Martha?** ✔ Correct. ("How are you, Martha?") **Ka** works because it is in predicate position after *Kumusta*.
4. **Magandang hapon po, Bb. Santos. Pasok po kayo.** ✔ Correct. Polite form of addressing with **po** + **kayo** for respect.
5. **Ikaw, ano ang pangalan mo?** ✔ Correct. ("You, what is your name?") Uses **ikaw** because it’s fronted for emphasis.
6. **Si Walter ako. Siya naman ay si Bert.** ✔ Correct. ("I am Walter. He, on the other hand, is Bert.") **Siya** correctly refers to Bert.
7. **Taga-saan sila, Bert?** ✔ Correct. ("Where are they from, Bert?") Subject is *sila*.
8. **Taga-Eastlake kami.** ✔ Correct. ("We are from Eastlake.") Uses **kami** (excludes the addressee).
9. **Lahat tayo ay kakain sa Jollibee ngayon!** ✔ Correct. ("All of us will eat at Jollibee today!") **Tayo** (includes speaker + audience).
10. **Hindi ba sila sasama?** ✔ Correct. ("Aren’t they coming along?") **Sila** is third-person plural.




## 🔑 Principles to Review



### 1. **Ako vs. Ko**



* **Ako** = subject ("I"). * Ex: *Ako si Oliver.*
* **Ko** = possessive/genitive ("my") or agent marker ("by me"). * Ex: *Ang pangalan ko ay Oliver.* * Ex: *Kinain ko ang mangga.* ("I ate the mango.")


👉 Rule: **Use "ako" when "I" is the doer/subject. Use "ko" when "I" is the possessor or actor after the verb.**


### 2. **Ka vs. Ikaw vs. Mo**



* **Ka** = used when following a verb or predicate. * *Kumusta ka?*
* **Ikaw** = used when starting a sentence or for emphasis. * *Ikaw ang mahal ko.*
* **Mo** = possessive/agent (like "your / by you"). * *Anong pangalan mo?*


👉 Rule: **Ikaw is emphatic/fronted. Ka follows the verb. Mo is genitive (your/by you).**


### 3. **Inclusive vs. Exclusive "We"**



* **Tayo** = we (including the person spoken to). * *Lahat tayo ay kakain.*
* **Kami** = we (excluding the person spoken to). * *Taga-Eastlake kami.*




### 4. **Word Order (Subject–Predicate vs. Predicate–Subject)**



* Filipino is usually **predicate-first** (verb/adjective/noun before subject). * *Maganda si Maria.* ("Maria is beautiful.")
* You can invert to **subject–predicate** for emphasis: * *Si Maria ay maganda.*
* With pronouns, this affects whether you use **ako/ikaw** vs. **ko/mo**.



✅ So overall, your sentences are fine. The key areas to review are:

1. **Ako vs. ko** (subject vs. possessive/agent).
2. **Ka vs. ikaw vs. mo** (position and emphasis).
3. **Kami vs. tayo** (exclusive vs. inclusive we).
4. **Predicate–subject pattern** (default word order in Filipino).



Do you want me to make you a **practice chart** with common sentence frames (ako/ko, ka/ikaw/mo, kami/tayo) so you can drill them?
