**ChatGPT:**

Which is correct? 


Kumusta ikaw or kumusta ka?

---

**ChatGPT:**

The correct and natural phrase is **“Kumusta ka?”**
Here’s why:

* **“Kumusta”** means *How are you?* (from the Spanish *¿Cómo está?*).
* **“Ka”** is the proper pronoun in Tagalog to refer to “you” when used in this context.
* So, **“Kumusta ka?”** directly means *How are you?*


Using **“Kumusta ikaw?”** is **grammatically awkward** in Tagalog. *Ikaw* (you) is usually used only when emphasizing the subject, for example:

* *“Ikaw, kumusta?”* → “And you, how are you?”


👉 In short:

* Everyday use: **Kumusta ka?** ✅
* Emphasis / contrast: **Ikaw, kumusta?**


Would you like me to also explain the difference between **“Kumusta ka po?”** vs **“Kumusta ka?”** (formal vs informal)?

**ChatGPT:**

is this quiz incorrect?

---

**ChatGPT:**

I see why you got marked wrong. The quiz question says:

Situation: You chance upon **Angie and Chris** in the cafeteria. You want to know how **they** are.

You chose **“Kumusta ka?”**, which is correct when talking to **one person** (“How are you?”).
But since the situation is about **two people (Angie and Chris)**, the correct answer should be **“Kumusta kayo?”** → *“How are you (all)?”*

### Quick breakdown of pronouns:



* **ka** → you (singular, informal)
* **ikaw** → you (singular, emphatic, usually at beginning of sentence)
* **kayo** → you (plural OR singular formal)
* **siya** → he/she


👉 So the quiz is correct: the answer is **“Kumusta kayo?”**
Would you like me to also make you a little **cheat sheet of common “kumusta” forms** (singular, plural, formal, emphatic) so you don’t get tripped up again on similar questions?
