**ChatGPT:**

translate these from filipino to english or from english to filipino:

Circle of Life
Respect

**ChatGPT:**

Here’s the set translated both ways for clarity:
**From Filipino → English**

* **Bata** → Child
* **Mano** → A gesture of respect where one takes an elder’s hand to touch it to their forehead (often translated as *to bless* or *respect gesture*)
* **Lola** → Grandmother


**From English → Filipino**

* **Age** → Edad
* **Growth** → Paglaki / Pag-unlad (context-dependent: physical vs personal development)
* **Circle of Life** → Ikot ng Buhay
* **Respect** → Paggalang


Would you like me to also put these into a structured **Anki JSON format** so you can directly add them to your Filipino study deck?
