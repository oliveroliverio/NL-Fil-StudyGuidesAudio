**ChatGPT:**

translate these to filipino.  Be sure to include both (noun-adjective and adjectie-noun orders)
- handsome student
- kind teacher
- big school
- cheap vegetable
- fragrant flower

**ChatGPT:**

Got it 👍 — in Filipino, you can say things both **noun + adjective** (common in everyday speech) and **adjective + noun** (more formal/literary or for emphasis). Here are the translations:


### 1. Handsome student



* **Estudyanteng guwapo** (noun + adjective)
* **Guwapong estudyante** (adjective + noun)



### 2. Kind teacher



* **Gurong mabait** (noun + adjective)
* **Mabait na guro** (adjective + noun)



### 3. Big school



* **Paaralang malaki** (noun + adjective)
* **Malaking paaralan** (adjective + noun)



### 4. Cheap vegetable



* **Gulay na mura** (noun + adjective)
* **Murang gulay** (adjective + noun)



### 5. Fragrant flower



* **Bulaklak na mabango** (noun + adjective)
* **Mabangong bulaklak** (adjective + noun)



👉 Note:

* When the adjective comes first, it often gets a linking particle or changes form (like *mabango → mabangong*, *malaki → malaking*).
* Everyday spoken Tagalog usually prefers **noun + adjective** (e.g., *estudyanteng guwapo*), while **adjective + noun** is often used in writing or when emphasizing the quality (*malaking paaralan!*).


Would you like me to also **explain the rule for when to use *na* vs. *-ng*** as the linker? That comes up in almost every example here.

**ChatGPT:**

no accents?  Í or á?

---

**ChatGPT:**

Great question 🙌
In **standard Filipino/Tagalog writing**, **we normally don’t write accent marks (diacritics)** like **í, á, ú**. You’ll see plain forms:

* **guwapo**, not *guwápo*
* **mabait**, not *mabaít*
* **paaralan**, not *paarálan*


Accents *do* exist in formal linguistic texts, dictionaries, and language learning materials, but they’re mainly used to:

1. **Show stress** (which syllable is emphasized). * *báta* = child * *batà* = robe
2. **Differentiate words with the same spelling but different pronunciation/meaning.** * *súlat* = act of writing * *sulát* = something written
3. **Mark glottal stops** (pauses at the throat). * *batà* (child) vs *batá* (young)


👉 Everyday Filipino (newspapers, novels, text messages, even government documents) leaves accents out, because readers rely on **context**.
So for your list (“handsome student,” “kind teacher,” etc.), it’s totally correct and natural to write them **without accents**.

Do you want me to **add the accent marks anyway** (like a “learning mode” version), so you can see exactly where the stress or glottal stop lands?
