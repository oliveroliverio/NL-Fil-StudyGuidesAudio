I think I want to switch to the Gemini 3 API rather than OpenAI. 

This is a great first start!  But I think I want a 3rd party API for audio file generation that specializes in audiobook creation for more natural sounding oral audio.  We can keep the the current LLM (or switch to Gemini 3) for creating the transcripts for stories and lessons.  But for oral audio generation, I want to explore better options, possibly even paid ones if the output is audible audiobook sounding. 

Don't code anything for now, simply write your ideas and next steps in this file.
