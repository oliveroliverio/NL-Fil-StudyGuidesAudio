write an instruction document followd by an LLM prompt for setting up a project with the following features/aspects
- Goal: automatedly create the framework and training data from ElevenLabs for the purposes of training a base model while simultaneously using as a consumer for text-to-speech applications such as my current use case in Filipino study
- The goal is to create both the ground truth data from the audio files generated by ElevenLabs paired with the transcript texts generated in this project.  
- As I continue to use and pay for Elevenlabs for my current use case, (developing audio basedFilipino study guides and stories), the artifacts created (audio files generated from Elevenlabs and transcript texts generated from this project) will be used to train a base model to the point where I can stop using Elevenlabs services.  
- NOTE: I have an RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Max-Q, and so design the project structure and requirements.txt accordingly.  
- This will be an entirely new project from the current one, but I'd like to be exhaustive with these initial prompts to ensure successful and efficient/quick development.  
- Start this project initially as a Jupyter Notebook and all the relevant packages in the requirements.txt file.  And structure it as if it were a professional AI engineering project complete with training data curation, preparation/QC, model checkpoints, and evaluation metrics.
