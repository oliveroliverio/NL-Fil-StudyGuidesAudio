Exploration for other learning media pipelines. Audio edition. Write an LLM prompt to build a system/pipeline that has a similar workflow to this (Raw markdown content/material -> python script to generate professional looking study guides utilizing antigravity and Gemini 3), but this time, create audiobooks. Here's the new workflow: Raw markdown content/material -> python script/program/app to generate professional transcripts for audio lessons or short stories implementing the content/material, then another script (needs to be separated from the first for better organization) that takes the transcript and sends it either to a 3rd party API for audio file generation or an open source free version of that depending on the quality (I'll decide).
